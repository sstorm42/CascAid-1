    "description": "In the past twelve years, 11th Hour Theatre Company has emerged as Philadelphia’s premier boutique musical theatre company. In 2016, 11th Hour was awarded a New Theatre Works Initiative grant by the Independence Foundation, and in 2013, 11th Hour became the first-ever recipients of the June and Steve Wolfson Award for an Evolving Theater. Our work focuses on presenting intimate, character-driven stories rather than flashy, budget-busting spectacles. Our hope is that these stories prove the relevance of musical theatre in the contemporary world, engaging audiences and inspiring the next generation of musical theatre artists for years to come.\r\n\r\nWe produce a broad spectrum of musicals that fill a niche in the diverse Philadelphia theatre landscape: musicals that spark the creativity of our artists and the imaginations of our audience. In the 2014-2015 season, we produced our first world premiere, Michael Ogborn’s Field Hockey Hot, which was a smashing success, and motivated us to create one of the first original cast albums to come out of Philadelphia in years. To date, we have produced twenty-one full-scale musicals, ten of which were Philadelphia premieres. Our hugely popular Next Step Concert Series is a staged-reading series that showcases musicals seldom seen in Philadelphia. In addition to Field Hockey Hot, the company has contributed to the development of several new musicals beginning with Angst, a ten-minute musical that premiered in the Spark Festival of 2005. We produced the American premiere of Austentatious that went on to success at the New York Musical Theatre Festival; and a 29-hour reading of Fantasy Football, the Musical? before its production at New York University. Both Austentatious and Fantasy Football have since been published and are now professionally licensed. In the fall of 2014, we partnered with University of the Arts to workshop Persephone Unplugged, a new twist on the classic Greek myth.",

    "description": "A Little Taste of Everything (ALTOE) is a non-profit agency whose mission is to increase access to nutritious, affordable foods and provide food system education for low-income populations in Philadelphia. ALTOE grew out of a youth-driven project at University City High School (UCHS) in conjunction with the Urban Nutrition Initiative (UNI) and received its non-profit status in 2005. ALTOE evolved from previous efforts to improve food security in West Philadelphia communities through school gardens and farmers’ markets.\r\n\r\nALTOE’s mission is put into action through the Mill Creek Farm (MCF), an educational urban farm project. The Mill Creek Farm (MCF) is located at 4901 Brown Street in the Mill Creek Neighborhood of West Philadelphia.  The Mill Creek runs under the land we work on and was enclosed in a sewer 100 years ago. Housing was built on fill that was not stable for the foundations and began to subside. It was eventually torn down in the 1970s. Since that time there has been a community garden on the western portion of the block, but the eastern portion sat vacant except for trash and weeds until 2005.  In August 2005, the Philadelphia Water Department awarded ALTOE 1.5 acres of vacant land, at 49th and Brown Streets in the Mill Creek Neighborhood of West Philadelphia, on which to start the project. Initial funding for MCF came from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection’s Growing Greener Grant for Stormwater Management and the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society (PHS). The Mill Creek Farm had a successful first season in 2006, and has continued to grow and progress as a model for local food system development and sustainability education in succeeding years.",

Our past and present initiatives focus on promoting the principles and commitments outlined in this seminal document.\r\n\r\nSince 2010, our work has focused primarily on advancing medical professionalism in the area of stewardship of health care resources. Programs supporting this work include the Choosing Wisely® campaign, the Teaching Value and Choosing Wisely® Challenge, and the Putting Stewardship into Medical Education and Training grant program.",

    "description": "The Academy of Cognitive & Behavioral Therapies, a non-profit organization, was founded in 1998 by a group of leading clinicians, educators, and researchers in the field of cognitive therapy. As part of its mission, the Academy supports continuing education and research in cognitive therapy, provides a valuable resource in cognitive therapy for professionals and the public at large, and actively works towards the identification and certification of clinicians skilled in cognitive therapy. Certification is awarded to those individuals who, based upon an objective evaluation, have demonstrated an advanced level of expertise in cognitive therapy. The Academy includes physicians, psychologists, social workers, and other mental health professionals from around the world. To date, there are over 1000 Members of the Academy.\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Cognitive & Behavioral Therapies is a multidisciplinary certifying organization specifically for cognitive-behavioral therapy that evaluates applicants' knowledge and ability before granting certification. The exacting standards of the Academy are designed to identify clinicians with the necessary training, experience, and knowledge to be effective cognitive therapists. Lack of rigor in certification represents a significant problem for both clinicians and consumers. Certification by the Academy of Cognitive Therapy indicates to the public, potential employers, and other clinicians that the individual is a skilled cognitive therapist.",

    "description": "Founded in 1812, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University is a leading natural history museum dedicated to advancing research, education, and public engagement in biodiversity and environmental science. Visitors to the Academy have the opportunity to get face-to-face with towering dinosaurs, meet live animals, and explore a tropical garden filled with live butterflies. Philadelphia’s natural history museum offers surprises for all ages, from changing interactive science exhibits to a children’s discovery center, a fossil dig, and opportunities to interact with real science experts.\r\n\r\nThe Academy’s working scientists spend their days focusing on critical global issues in biodiversity, evolution, and environmental science. In the field, Academy scientists have traveled as far as Vietnam to sample wild bird populations for emerging diseases such as avian influenza, and closer to home they have been studying the effects of natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale. These research efforts and many others enable the Academy to provide accurate, real-time scientific information to the public on environmental and sustainability matters.\r\n\r\nThe Academy’s collections contain more than 18 million specimens and archival treasures and rate among the world’s most significant in terms of geographic, biological, and historical depth and breadth. Many specimens in the Academy’s collections predate the institution’s founding and reflect the work of famous naturalists and scientists, including Thomas Jefferson, John James Audubon, Meriwether Lewis, and William Clark. This “library of life” records the extraordinary diversity of life on Earth and preserves a long-term record of environmental change.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Academy CEO George W. Gephart, Jr., and Drexel University President John A. Fry announced the completion of a historic affiliation between the Academy and Drexel. This unique affiliation unites two of Philadelphia's most respected research institutions and promotes discovery, learning, and civic engagement in the natural and environmental sciences.",

By the early 2000s however, the organization expanded its goals to include providing social, health and legal services for the African immigrant and refugee community in Philadelphia. This expansion was due in large part to the influx of African refugees fleeing war in various West African countries, including Liberia, Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast. Today, ACANA provides a variety of services that encourage education, community development and integration while still preserving cultural values.",

This work led ASAP to rallying around the four citywide initiatives it has today – ASAP Chess, ASAP Debate, ASAP Drama, and ASAP Scrabble.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this shift in focus was profound. By 2007, ASAP’s four citywide initiatives were serving more than 4,000 youth. During this time, ASAP also assumed leadership of the Philadelphia Scholastic Chess League and the Philadelphia Scholastic Debate League. Both leagues flourished under ASAP’s direction, quickly rivaling the District’s athletic leagues in size",

    "description": "The name AKWD comes from the phrase \"any kid will do.\"  The phrase \"any kid will do\" was originally written by artist and founding director, George E. Barrick as a humorous and heartfelt addition to a hand drawn nondiscrimination policy sign he was asked to make at his first job as a preschool teacher 20 years earlier.  Over the years, the possible interpretations of the phrase, any kid is capable & any kid will participate, eventually permeated all aspects of his methods as an educator and director. In January of 2004, AKWD became a 501(C)3 nonprofit born of Barrick's overwhelming desire as a preschool educator to finally \"get this right.\" Today AKWD is an innovative educational model. George Barrick passed away in 2008 but his project is carried on as a labor of love by  original collaborators and some new friends as well.\r\n\r\nThe intention of AKWD is to assist young humans in appreciating their own ability in a respectful loving environment. By acknowledging the multiple intelligences and diverse strengths of each child our  faculty of teachers and specialists introduce students to the value of questioning and exploring their immediate and expanding environments.",

    "description": "Since establishment in 1953, Allens Lane Art Center has been a cornerstone of the Mt. Airy community by bringing the residents together to participate in and enjoy the arts.  Whether its art classes for children or adults, amazing art exhibitions, or cutting edge plays on the mainstage, there is something for everyone at Allens Lane.\r\n\r\nAllens Lane Art Center (ALAC) was founded in 1953 by an interracial group of Mt. Airy residents who were concerned about the dangers of increasing community tension. Most were parents of children attending local schools who felt that increasing access to the arts would be a way to bring people together as well as develop individual talents. \"Living Together Through the Arts,\" a program of The Ford Foundation and the Henry Home & School Association, originally sponsored ALAC.  We formally incorporated as a nonprofit organization - 501 c(3) - on June 29, 1953.\r\n\r\nALAC's founders saw creative activities as an effective avenue for channeling the energy of youth in a constructive way. Developing artistic skills and appreciation for the arts would help round the education of local youth and build self-esteem in a non-competitive way. Most importantly, creative activities would bring people of diverse backgrounds together and help them overcome prejudices. Today, Allens Lane still promotes \"living together in the community through arts\" by offering programs and activities that enrich the lives of numerous children and adults.",

It is estimated that twenty percent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and/or depression. Also, an alarming average of 22 veterans commit suicide every day here in the United States, that’s 8,030 in just one year.\r\n\r\nAlpha Bravo Canine was founded by a mother and son team to help the local community of veterans. Jennifer Green, CPDT-KA is a certified dog trainer and her son Kevin Daly, USMC was deployed to Afghanistan twice with the 1st Battalion 8th Marine Regiment. Upon Kevin’s return home, they decided to combine their knowledge and experience of dog training and post deployment struggles to tackle these growing problems, and help to lower the suicide rates of US veterans by providing emotional and physical support with trained service dogs.\r\n\r\nAlpha Bravo Canine believes in helping these brave warriors, who fought for our country’s freedom, by giving back to them.\r\n\r\nProviding these veterans a trained service dog. A fully trained service dog from puppy to graduated dog can cost approximately $25,000-30,000 for up to the two year time frame. Everything we do is – free of charge – A service dog will make a huge difference in their lives!",

Alston. The foundation recognizes his contribution as a humanitarian, as well as Beech's charitable involvement to the Cecil B. Moore community. Both Beech and Mr. Alston's vision of philanthropic giving has been paramount to the revitalization of the community and the foundation's mission will be consistent with the Beech Interplex philosophy of enhancing the urban environment.",

The objectives of the organization as given in the constitution are “the cultivation of social relations among the graduates, the promotion of the best interests of the school, and the furthering in every way of all efforts looking to the enlargement of opportunities for women.”\r\n\r\nThroughout the years the Alumnae Association has been interested in the school and the welfare of its faculty and students. The extreme care that every administration has taken of the funds derived from that famous 1891 Bazaar has given us a sound investment program today. It enables us to maintain an exceptional scholarship program: Numerous alumnae each year receive generous tuition support at colleges and universities. We also give Commencement prizes and tuition grants. Since 1963 we have contributed thousands of dollars as well as books to the GHS library. We donate to school funds and publications. In 1984 we began to subsidize the cost of Advanced Placement examinations taken by qualified seniors. Our support today ranges from capital projects like the installation of a dance floor and statue restoration, to student activities like the robotics team and academic competitions, to subsidies for graduation festivities. In 2001, we finished production of a video history of Girls’ High that highlighted events of our school’s sesquicentennial year in 1998.\r\n\r\nNow over 4,800 financial members strong, as the alumnae association celebrates its 125th anniversary, we take pride in our heritage, and eagerly anticipate the challenges that lie ahead. Join us, in supporting our enduring tradition of excellence!",

    "description": "America’s most isolated and at-risk children are the estimated 7.3 million children who have one or both parents under some form of state or federal supervision. Without effective intervention, 70 percent of these children will likely follow their parent’s path into jail or prison. The Amachi mentoring program was developed to provide them with a different path - by establishing the consistent presence of loving, caring people of faith.\r\n\r\nAmachi mentors meet weekly with a child who has been carefully matched with them; they often live and worship in the same neighborhoods as the children. Amachi’s hope is that one-to-one mentoring by caring adults will significantly improve the life opportunities of the children. Studies have clearly demonstrated that the Big Brother Big Sister (BBBS) mentoring model has positive effects - and now through Amachi, the strengths of mentoring and congregational volunteers are brought together.\r\n\r\n“Amachi” is a Nigerian Ibo word that means “Who knows but what God has brought us through this child.”",

The EMPF focuses on the development, application and transfer of new electronics manufacturing technology by partnering with industry, academia and government centers and laboratories in the United States in order to maximize available research capabilities at the lowest possible cost. ACI also provides training, consulting, testing, analysis, and engineering services to the electronics industry.\r\n\r\nACI was established in 1992 by its founder and current CEO, Alan J. Criswell. His vision was to develop a vehicle to bridge the gap between leading edge applied research efforts in electronics manufacturing and the successful integration of the developed technologies on the factory floor. Relying on a thorough understanding of the dynamics of the electronics industry and knowledge of the ever-increasing void in successful technology insertion, ACI successfully privatized a regional, government operated laboratory known as the EMPF in 1995. ACI transformed this facility into a National Center of Excellence offering best-in-class technical resources in electronics manufacturing to the U.S. Navy, the Department of Defense, and industry.\r\n\r\nToday, ACI's National Center of Excellence Model serves as a conduit to leverage the nation's best technical resources from government, industry, and academia in a cooperative and cost-efficient effort to maximize the development and insertion of electronics manufacturing technologies across a broad base of industrial partners. This leveraged technical capability has and will continue to contribute greatly to ensuring the competitiveness of the U.S. industrial base in electronics manufacturing.",

The Forum recognized that local Chapters could engage artists and communities in metropolitan areas more directly, vitally and efficiently than a distant, national entity could. Using this approach, the ACF Philadelphia engages composers and local residents with a wide range of creative, educational, and performance activities tailored to needs and circumstances specific to the city, its neighborhoods, and the artists who live and work here.

    "description": "Founded in 1926, the American Swedish Historical Museum in South Philadelphia is the oldest Swedish museum in the United States. 1926 marked the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and Americans from all backgrounds were celebrating their heritage and their contributions to the United States of America. The museum’s founder, Dr. Amandus Johnson inspired a group of committed, successful Swedish-Americans to build the Museum as a permanent monument to Swedish contributions in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Museum is located on land that was once part of a seventeenth-century land grant from Queen Christina of Sweden to Swedish colonist, Sven Skute. The Museum’s architect, Swedish-American John Nydén, combined architectural features from three prominent edifices in his design. He modeled the main building after a seventeenth-century Swedish manor house, Eriksberg in Södermanland. The copper cupola atop the building is inspired by the one on Stockhlom’s City Hall, and the arcades which flank the Museum are patterned after those at George Washington’s home, Mount Vernon.\r\n\r\nThe Museum’s 20,000 square foot interior is currently divided into twelve exhibition galleries, reference library, curatorial storage and archives, offices, museum store, large dining room/conference area and kitchen. The Museum is available to rent for wedding receptions, corporate meetings, and parties",

    "description": "The Society is the first organization to operate Belmont Mansion primarily as an historic site. And the Society is the only African-American Women's organization to administer an historic mansion in Fairmount Park. The Society has drawn attention to the importance of Belmont Mansion. In the 1987 Assessment of Ten Historic Structures in Fairmount Park considered to be at risk, Belmont Mansion was singled out as the most significant structure studied, and among the most important in Fairmount Park. This work was followed by a complete historical study and architectural analysis published as The Belmont Mansion Historical Structures Report. On this basis, the restoration of Belmont Mansion became the first major project of the Fairmount Park Historic Preservation Trust in 1994.\r\n\r\nThe AWHS is a non-profit historic preservation organization that raises funds from membership fees, admissions, rentals, grants and donations. Through the Society, Belmont Mansion has become an interpretive and educational center for American history and culture. The Society seeks to expose the community to the fine arts (literature, art, dance and music), as well as build bridges of communication and interaction among various ethnic communities in Philadelphia. Belmont Mansion also serves as a site for wedding receptions, private parties, meetings of civic and cultural organizations, and tours for visitors.",

    "description": "ANNA Crusis Women’s Choir is the longest-running feminist women’s choir in the United States, founded in 1975 by Dr. Catherine Roma. When deciding on a name for this new choir, Cathy liked the play on words that the musical term anacrusis lent itself to. By adding another “n” and making it a woman’s name, her small start-up group had immediate personality and warmth.\r\n\r\nToday, ANNA is a widely recognized vocal ensemble in Philadelphia, with 80+ singers, committed to musical excellence and promoting social change. Led by Artistic Director Miriam Davidson, ANNA’s membership embraces diversity of age, ethnicity, and gender identity; our music repertoire reflects the rich spectrum of human lives and struggles, shedding light on issues facing immigrants and refugees, young people, women, the LGBTQ+ community, and others.\r\n\r\nANNA self-produces two major concerts each year and performs many community outreach programs throughout the season. We can often be heard singing at benefits, rallies, LGBTQ+ community events, prisons and shelters — anywhere that music can bring a sense of hope and empowerment. ANNA has performed at numerous venues in Philadelphia and New York City, such as the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, the Annenberg Center, World Café Live, the United Nations, and Carnegie Hall. We are honored to have been invited to participate in the International Festival of Choirs to be held in Santiago de Cuba this coming October/November 2019. ANNA has also sung with artists including Dr. Ysaye Barnwell (Sweet Honey In the Rock), Demi Lovato, Holly Near, Melanie DeMore, Sharon Katz and the Peace Train, and a host of others.",

We provide comprehensive and collaborative programs throughout Philadelphia in schools, social service agencies, the courts, and at community sites.",

    "description": "AVP was incorporated as a 501c(3) organization in 1983. The following year, Families of Murder Victims (FMV) opened in the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Homicide Unit to serve individuals who have lost a loved one to homicide. By the 1990s, AVP was gearing up to expand its reach. In 1996, AVP established the Counseling Center, which provides free therapeutic counseling to children, families and individuals who have witnessed or experienced violence in their lives.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, AVP established West/Southwest Victim Services, a program supporting and advocating for victims of violent crime in a community-based setting. In October 2007, AVP began collaborating with the Medical Examiner’s Office where AVP’s crisis intervention specialists work to meet the immediate practical and emotional needs of victims’ loved ones in the days following a homicide, including providing support at the time of identification of their loved one’s remains and assistance in receiving compensation for funeral and other related costs.\r\n\r\nThe Youth Violence Outreach (YVO) initiative was established in the fall of 2016. By identifying young people who have experienced violence-related trauma and providing them with effective counseling and therapy to help them process the experience, YVO works to interrupt the cycle of violence. The school-based work is a combination of services that provide trauma-informed care directly to youth, emphasizing outreach to adolescent males of color who have the highest rates of victimization and violent behavior and who are often difficult to reach in non-school settings.\r\n\r\nAVP programs and staff have been recognized by many local, regional, and national awards. In 1989, the organization received an award for Excellence in Victim Services from the National Organization for Victim Assistance and an award from the Philadelphia County Medical Society for Outstanding Health Services followed in 1994. Most recently, in 2004, AVP was a recipient of the GlaxoSmithKline Community Partnerships IMPACT award, given to non-profit organizations for excellence in improving the healthcare of the underserved in their communities.",

    "description": "Philadelphia has more than 32,000 vacant lots; it is one of the defining problems of our city, and one of its potential advantages, as well. In late 2013, the city passed legislation to create a Land Bank that will dispose of vacant city property, and oversee the disposition of abandoned private property. In the Land Bank Strategic Plan adopted in December 2014, the East Kensington neighborhood was designated a focus area for urban agriculture and open space. To this end, Arcadia Commons is in the process of acquiring sixteen blighted vacant parcels in East Kensington that are in danger of being developed exclusively for expensive housing.\r\n\r\nResearch shows that urban green spaces not only foster community, but also contribute to the health and wellness of local residents. Arcadia Commons’ designated parcels would be used for community gardening, a farmers market, and a pavilion for neighborhood gatherings, and educational workshops to teach people in the community techniques for growing herbs, flowers, and produce as well as marketable skills (soap-making, spinning yarn). The products derived from local production would be put up for sale at the farmers market or used for personal consumption. Through these methods, Arcadia Commons will serve area residents by providing affordable resources that will revitalize local business and build a healthy local economy.",

    "description": "ArtSmart was born in 2015 by co-founders Michael Fabiano and John Viscardi after long analysis of the US education system, role models, technology and the economic state of affairs for artists living and working in the United States. \r\n\r\nAs artists, Michael and John had also experienced the challenges of making a living while pursuing their dreams in their early careers. For many young professional artists, working one, two or three side jobs is commonplace. More often than not, these jobs are in an industry unrelated to their area of expertise, exhausting and pull focus at a time when it needs to be developed most. \r\n\r\nArtSmart was born out of these central ideas: to create an organization that gives students in underserved communities an opportunity to pursue their dreams and grow as human beings, while supporting actively working artists to accomplish their own professional goals. \r\n\r\nArtSmart launched its pilot program at Newark’s East Side High School in September 2016. The first program of its kind, ArtSmart will have provided over 25,000 mentor sessions by mid year 2020 in 28 schools nationwide. Lessons are free of charge to the student, while mentors are compensated a competitive rate for their time and focus. The foundation serves communities in and around San Francisco, Newark, Jersey City, Philadelphia, New York City and Chicago.",

This agency was founded by 125 Latino musicians in 1982 to counter the misrepresentation of Latino culture and to advocate for better working conditions for Latino musicians in the community. Asociación formed the Latin School for the Performing Arts (LSPA) for the development of artists and musicians, provided presentations and festivals for the community and became known for its specialized “Roots of Puerto Rican Music” workshops. This local success earned the organization national recognition including the national “Growing Up Taller” award (1997) for providing top level programming to at-risk youth, as well as Latin Beat magazine’s Siempre Salsa Special Recognition Award (2005) for extraordinary work in the field of Latin music education.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, founder Jesse Bermudez reached out to the Reverend Luis Cortés Jr, President of Esperanza to forge a strategic partnership. This relationship resulted in the creation of a new organization that draws upon the history and services of the former—and so AMLA (Artistas y Musicos Latino Americanos) was born in the Hunting Park neighborhood of Philadelphia.",

    "description": "ArtWell has grown to partner with over 400 organizations and serve more than 37,000 youth in the Greater Philadelphia region. At least 85% of the young people we work with are residents of low-income neighborhoods in Philadelphia. In 2019, we served nearly 1,000 students in the greater Philadelphia area ages 5-18, including youth from private, public, and disciplinary schools, as well as community organizations and libraries.\r\n\r\nOur innovative approach utilizes best practices in Critical Pedagogy, Multicultural Education, Asset Based Youth Development and Social-Emotional Learning. Workshops are student-centered and combine the building and mastery of arts skills with dialogue, inquiry, and reflection to explore “big ideas” and essential questions that are relevant in young people’s lives. Teaching artists engage youth in critical thought and often difficult dialogues through creativity and self expression by creating a community where students feel safe to be their authentic selves, share stories, take risks and grow.\r\n\r\nBy fostering creativity, enhancing communication and literacy skills, ArtWell helps individuals from diverse cultures and faith traditions to deepen their understandings of themselves and their community and to ultimately reduce violence and increase peace within our city and region.",

Since that time, Asian American’s United’s mission has been to grow leadership in Asian American communities to build our neighborhoods and unite against oppression.\r\n\r\nFor more than three decades, AAU has worked in Philadelphia’s Asian American communities and in broader multiracial coalitions around quality education, youth leadership, anti-Asian violence, immigrant rights, neighborhood development, and folk arts and cultural maintenance.\r\n\r\nAmong AAU’s accomplishments are: initiating and monitoring the settlement of a lawsuit with the School District of Philadelphia to improve services to immigrant students; developing the ​leadership of hundreds of youth; creating the Chinatown Mid-Autumn Festival; founding Chinatown Vote; and founding the Folk Arts-Cultural Treasures Charter School.​\r\n\r\nAAU is the recipient of numerous awards for services to youth, folk arts programs, organizational excellence and intergenerational leadership.",

    "description": "The relationship between the Alumni and the School started almost immediately after the 1st Class graduated in 1842 with the founding of our predecessor organization. By 1873, when the alumni formally reorganized, the AACHS was actively supporting the school’s activities.\r\n\r\nIt is critical for the future of the school that we, as graduates, give back to the school by: endowed gifts to support programs (including Science Fair, Robotics, Dramatics, Publications, Music, Art and Athletics); by our presence with Career Day; by support of special events such as International Day, and by promotion of Central’s activities through the media. We also participate in the student recruitment process, and help students and recent graduates with networking and interning opportunities. We administer close to $2 million of endowed scholarship and prize funds for the benefit of both underclassmen/women and seniors; the annual distribution of proceeds averages about 8%.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate demonstration of our commitment was the rebuilding of the Barnwell Library into a 21st century research facility and conference center. This landmark public-private partnership with the CHS faculty, students and the School District has changed the learning culture in the school. Teachers from all disciplines use the research lab to effectively teach students how to properly perform internet research.\r\n\r\nAACHS also provided for the construction of a new faculty lounge, and gifted laptop computers to all faculty members, allowing for more cross-pollination of ideas between members of various departments.\r\n\r\nThe Association works with the senior and junior class officers. They, as well as the president of the Student Association and the Editor-in-Chief of the Centralizer, participate in AACHS Board of Managers meetings. Our Alumni Journal and web site highlight school activities to encourage graduates to connect with the Central of today. AACHS also works with the Home and School Association and support its activities to assist parents to support their children’s life at Central.\r\n\r\nAlumni, on an individual basis, support the work of literary publications, and robotics by working with and advising students. They volunteer to chaperone events, such as Museum Day, and pay for students to attend alumni events such as our annual lunch, annual dinner meeting, and Thanksgiving Day Victory Breakfast.",

    "description": "AGLP, celebrating over 40 years of service to the LGBTQ Community, traces its roots to the late 1960s, when gay and lesbian members of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) met secretly at the annual meetings. At that time, in most states, homosexuality could be used as cause for the loss of licensure to practice psychiatry.  After the now-infamous appearance by Dr. John Fryer In 1972, and the behind-the-scenes work of several members of what was then referred to as the GayPA, the APA removed homosexuality from their diagnostic manual (DSM). This allowed a more open association of lesbian and gay psychiatrists, who no longer had to fear for their jobs if they were found out to be gay.  Even today, the mission of providing support and a safe space for LGBTQ+ psychiatrists to meet continues to be important to many of our members. AGLP is the oldest association of LGBTQ+ professionals in the country.\r\n\r\nAGLP is an independent organization from APA, but works closely with APA through LGBTQ+ representation on the APA Assembly (the LGBT Caucus of the APA), APA position statements, LGBTQ+ Committees of the DSM, the creation and staffing of an AIDS Committee, Awards, such as the Dr. John Fryer, M.D., Award, and research and advocacy of particular interest to the LGBTQ+ Community through our quarterly Journal of Gay and Lesbian Mental Health. AGLP offers an online referral service to those seeking LGBTQ+-friendly counselling, support, and psychiatric treatment. \r\n\r\nIn 2015, The Association of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrists changed its name to AGLP: The Association of LGBTQ+ Psychiatrists, in order to serve a broader constituency of members and patients in the LGBTQ community.\r\n\r\nAGLP continues to work with APA and independently to support our members and advocate for our patients.",

    "description": "Since its inception in 2010, ACCR has served as Pennsylvania’s only resource for comprehensive capital punishment case services. Our original slogan was, “Trying to put ourselves out of business since 2010”, and it wasn’t a joke. In its first 10 years, ACCR has fought hard, unrelenting in the hope that its services on death penalty cases would be rendered unnecessary. When the Pennsylvania Supreme Court refused to accept years’ worth of research done by the legislative task force (which included our co-founder Dana Cook and board member Reggie Shuford), it renewed ACCR’s determination to continue to provide for and work alongside the lawyers who fight for their client’s lives. \r\n\r\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Miller v. Alabama in 2016 prohibiting mandatory life-without-parole sentences for crimes committed by children, ACCR became one of the first organizations to participate in facilitating this new opportunity for a second chance for the hundreds of Pennsylvania prisoners. 25 percent of the two thousand prisoners condemned to life without parole as children were from Pennsylvania.  \r\n\r\nLooking forward, we know that if the death penalty were abolished, ACCR’s work would not be done. ACCR’s mission has focused on capital punishment, but its broader concerns about injustice, racism, and fairness within our criminal legal system are still pervasive.",

We, as Augustinians and laypeople, must make poverty the center of our ministry and devote a major portion of our time, talents and resources to fostering systemic change in the way poverty is addressed.\r\n\r\n We must join with educational institutions, parish ministries, and other grassroots organizations to use their expertise to understand the causes of poverty and what can be done to effect real, sustainable change.",

    "description": "Harry Lawson formed the 12th Ward String Band on May 11th, 1938, but as of 1944, the band had rebranded itself as the Avalon String Band. However, after so many years of financial distress and mediocre finishes, Avalon disbanded. It was on March 23, 1982, when a brave group of men (some still marching with us today), took a shot on a then-struggling group, and Avalon was reborn. The band has continued to have great success, finishing in the top ten all but three times since the reorganization. \r\n\r\nThroughout the years, Avalon has been fortunate enough to play all over the world, which included stops in New Orleans, Dublin, and Sicily. More notably, the band has also had the privilege to play at Governor Ed Rendell’s Inaugural Ball, as well as the Presidential Inaugural Parade for Bill Clinton – an honor that very few bands can say they hold.",

The Avenue is one of the most vibrant and successful performing arts, residential, educational, commercial, and tourist destinations in the United States.\r\n\r\nEconomic impact from arts and culture on the Avenue of the Arts has grown exponentially creating thousands of jobs and generating significant tax revenue for the city and state. A study completed in 2015 by the cultural data project shows that over $795 million of economic impact is generated by arts and culture activities on the Avenue. These activities have created over 10,900 jobs, $265 million in wages, $17.5 million in local tax dollars, and $22.9 in state tax dollars. The Avenue of the Arts continues to evolve with significant residential development replacing office space creating new sources for economic development and commercial growth. South Broad Street has been recognized by the American Planning Association as one of the “Great Places of America”. The Avenue’s renowned performance venues, luxury hotels and eateries, universities, and residences are just a few reasons why the Avenue was given this prestigious recognition.",

    "description": "In the fall of 2011, Azuka Theatre along with Inis Nua Theatre Company took up residence in The First Baptist Church at 17th & Sansom where we carved out a 75-seat black box theater as well as office and rehearsal space. Named The Off-Broad Street Theater, Azuka produced 11 shows over the next four years, having expanded our programming to three shows a season. When a new congregation took over the building in 2015, we were forced to leave. Soon after, InterAct Theatre Company opened the brand new Theatres at The Drake that included two new performance spaces. We gladly joined the group of theaters there as Resident Partners. Since that time we have continued producing three shows a year, alternating between the two spaces. The Theaters at the Drake are known as Philadelphia’s Home for New Plays, and we embrace that moniker, so far producing eight world premieres there - all by Philadelphia-based playwrights.",

Under her eighteen years of leadership The Village’s summer park building project developed into an organization with twenty full-time and part-time employees, hundreds of volunteers, and a $1.3 million budget.\r\nThe Village has become a multi-faceted community building organization with activities including after-school and weekend programs, greening land transformation, housing renovation, theater, and economic development initiatives. The center works on local to international projects, and has been a leading model of community revitalization. The Village is under new and wonderful leadership with great vitality and programs. Please visit villagearts.org to learn more.\r\n\r\nLily Yeh developed a unique methodology for using the arts as a tool for community building and personal transformation during her tenure at The Village. Founding Barefoot Artists in 2002, Lily Yeh now works internationally on projects in places including Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana, Ecuador, and China. The Barefoot Artist aims to train and empower local residents, organize communities, and take action for a more compassionate, just, and sustainable future.\r\n\r\nThe Barefoot Artist is a volunteer-based organization with few encumbrances of staff and overhead. Lily Yeh raises funds for specific projects that pair volunteer expertise with local people to improve environments, and to advance health, education, and economic development. When funds are raised for a project, a call for volunteers is held and some paid staff are organized.\r\n\r\nDuring the project process, participants learn Barefoot Artists methodology on community building and economic development through art. We aim to inspire participants to initiate new projects, bring other volunteers, find new funding sources and discover other opportunities to serve communities. We intend for the programs initiated by volunteers to become multifaceted and interconnected in order to serve communities in need.",

    "description": "The history of Beacon Theatre Productions begins in 2011 with Georgina Bard – a theatre artist in the Philadelphia area who saw the need for theatre that not only educates, inspires, and challenges, but is accessible to communities and individuals who may not have the means to experience it otherwise. With this desire, she incorporated the company in 2011, sought out board members and other professionals, and by July of 2012, Beacon Theatre Productions became an official 501(c)(3) organization.\r\n\r\nSince 2011, Beacon Theatre Productions has found a place in the Philadelphia community: producing theatre that spotlights critical moments of the past to show the way to a better more equitable  future. Shows are often free to the public or offered at affordable ticket prices. Since 2011, BTP has brought plays to a variety of venues including schools, community centers, historical sites, senior living communities, churches and other indoor and outdoor locations. We have produced plays about the enslavement of people of color, those who worked for the abolition of slavery, the mistreatment of employees prior to the establishment of labor unions, the struggle to obtain woman's suffrage, the unjust treatment of Black soldiers during the American Civil War, and a deeper compassion for those experiencing trauma and grief. We have brought to life the characters of:  O. Henry, Arthur Conan Doyle, Frederick Douglass, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, C.S. Lewis, Sigmund Freud, Harriet Forten Purvis, Charlotte Forten Grimké, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucretia and James Mott. We have also hosted other theatre artists' portrayal  of  historical characters such as Mrs. Deborah Franklin, Harriet Tubman, Richard Allen, Dorothy Day, Sojourner Truth and more.",

    "description": "Beyond the Bars focuses on providing positive and safe spaces where youth who have been impacted by violence or the incarceration system can express themselves. We work to create pathways into music throughout the city with our community partners. We run music programs with a number of anti-violence and trauma informed programs throughout the city where students have an opportunity to learn the basics of songwriting and recording. When students identify music as a passion we bring students into our transition team where students can receive further supports and lessons as they prepare to join one of our additional programs. Students can then join our Student Driven Music Academy or Practical Producer Program where they will have ongoing supports as they grow in their musical journey. Lastly students can join a Teacher Training Track where they can continue to grow into becoming paid teachers for the next generation.\r\n\r\nThroughout all of our programming we focus on helping our students realize their talent and grow their self efficacy. Beyond the Bars currently offers over 8 different programs throughout the city using two main models: Our Student Driven Music Academy and our Practical Producers Program. These programs are performed throughout North, West and Northeast Philadelphia and works to serve students of various backgrounds.

Black Pearl's concert programming connects countries, cultures and communities in exciting ways.   In recognition of its world-class performance quality, Black Pearl has received numerous grants from the National Endowment for the Arts.

We are a community organization of over fifteen hundred families devoted to providing team sports for our children. Although the large majority of our members are from Mt.Airy and Chestnut Hill, they also reside in various nearby communities including Germantown, Roxborough, Oak Lane, Whitemarsh, Erdenheim, Lafayette Hill, Wyndmoor, Flourtown and Oreland. Men, women, parents and non-parents, of all ages and ethnic, racial and social backgrounds volunteer to coach the teams, run the leagues, and administer the club. Their time and dedication benefit an equally diverse group of thirteen hundred children who live or go to school in the Northwest Philadelphia community.",

Teachers in all grade levels and disciplines, and students of all abilities participate in DT Philly, which can be incorporated into class or run as an extracurricular activity.\r\n\r\nTeams begin their DT Philly journey learning about their relationship to the spaces, systems, and products that surround them.  Next they craft an essential question about a problem they see or experience, then they research the problem, and they brainstorm, prototype, and test potential solutions. \r\n\r\nAs students use the design framework to explore their challenges, they engage in new ways with teachers, peers, and their own learning.  Along the way there are moments of excitement and discovery as well as opportunities for growth, as students grapple with time management and team dynamics, as they seek to understand root causes and find new ways of looking at a problem, and as they confront constraints on what is desirable and what is feasible.",

    "description": "Breakthrough increases educational opportunity by focusing on the development of both students and teachers. Through academic enrichment and college access, Breakthrough prepares students who have limited educational opportunities to attend and succeed at competitive high schools and, ultimately, to envision themselves at four-year colleges. Simultaneously, Breakthrough develops future educators by providing professional teaching experiences to college students through its selective residency programs.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1995, Breakthrough of Greater Philadelphia (Breakthrough Philly) is a year-round academic enrichment program that builds a path from middle school to college graduation for underserved students from Philadelphia’s public, parochial, and charter schools.\r\n\r\nBreakthrough also inspires talented high school and college students to become educators and engaged citizens by giving them responsibility for teaching in its programs.  Breakthrough believes in the power of education to radically change young peoples’ lives. We believe the middle school years are the critical crossroads where students make choices that will dramatically affect their futures. We are passionate in our belief that every child deserves access to an excellent education and the encouragement to succeed.",

BSM seeks to be dynamic in its expression of worship, embracing those both on the margins of faith and those who have enjoyed the embrace of the church.\r\n\r\nBSM also welcomes into its body not just those who are on the margins of faith but those who are on the margins of society. Here, a member of a prestigious private club worships alongside a person experiencing homelessness. The gay and lesbian activist passes the peace with the Pentecostal lay preacher. The possessor of a PhD. in theology prays alongside the summa cum laude graduate of the School of Hard Knocks. Churches should regularly feature this kind of diversity but in our experience—they seldom do. We believe that diversity of belief, skin tone and life circumstance strengthens our witness as a Christian community—and we work hard to extend it. We worship weekly at 4pm.BSM tries to be faithful to Christ’s call to gather together all who can hear his voice.",

    "description": "At Caring for Friends, our specialty and what we’re passionate about, can be boiled down to two simple, yet crucial, aspects of life: food and friendship.\r\n\r\nOur food bank and senior meals program, with the help of thousands of volunteers, are driven by our mission to provide food and friendship to seniors, kids families in the five counties of Greater Philadelphia.  Our volunteer visitors meet with client friends throughout the 5-county greater Philadelphia region, providing them with much-needed home-cooked meals. But, more valuable than that, these visitors also nourish our clients with friendship, all free of charge.\r\n\r\nCaring for Friends volunteers prepare meals that are stored in freezers in over 200 secular and religious organizations and our Caring Center in northeast Philadelphia. From there, volunteer visitors pick up these meals and distribute them in weekly visits with clients. Most of our clients, whom we refer to as our friends, are elderly individuals who could not otherwise remain in their homes without the support of the meals we bring them.",

Apprentices must attend close to 1000 hours of related technical classroom instruction and up to 8,000 hours of on-the-job practical training to achive journeymen status. As their training progresses, apprentices earn more until they become full carpenters, called “journeymen,” and are then paid at the journeymen rate.\r\n\r\nThe apprenticeship program is designed to thoroughly develop the talents and skills of up-and-coming carpenters. The program is a combination of classroom learning and job site employment. Apprentices attend classes for one 8 hour day per week and complete 32 hours of on the job training during that week. This system is designed to accommodate the needs of contractors and apprentices alike. . As a result, apprentices are continuously building upon their knowledge and skill base while solidifying these lessons in a practical job site setting.",

It hosted the First Continental Congress in 1774 and was home to Franklin's Library Company, The American Philosophical Society, and the First and Second Banks of the United States.  Carpenters' Hall is the official birthplace of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a key meeting place in the early history of the United States.\r\n\r\nCompleted in 1775, the two-story brick meeting hall was built for and still privately owned by the Carpenters' Company of the City and County of Philadelphia, the country's oldest extant craft guild. The First Continental Congress met here in 1774 and it was the location of the Pennsylvania Provincial Conference in June 1776. Their proceedings officially declared the Province of Pennsylvania's independence from the British Empire and established the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, mobilized the Pennsylvania militia for the American Revolutionary War, set up the machinery for the Pennsylvania Provincial Convention which framed the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, and enabled the United States Declaration of Independence to proceed. It was briefly occupied in 1777 by the British Army during the war.\r\n\r\nThe site was designated a National Historic Landmark on April 15, 1970.",

    "description": "Our desire is not for another building open on Sundays only, but a place for positive holistic progress and spiritual growth.  The vision is not to build or have a building for \"church as usual\".  We, at Cathedral of Faith Church envision the following for God’s House:\r\n\r\n- A welcoming place that is open to all, for all to celebrate our gracious God. \r\n\r\n- A sanctuary for the needy that would offer food, clothing and counseling to obtain shelter.\r\n\r\n- A place that is open seven days a week offering noon-day prayer for everybody, every day. \r\n\r\n- A place to train the unemployed useable skills to obtain gainful employment.\r\n\r\n- A place for seniors to mentor young people and give guidance for their life’s journey. \r\n\r\n- A place that is available for other ministries to come and elevate their ministry objectives.\r\n\r\nThis will be God’s house where he will get non-stop glory from all who will enter its doors.",

Pennsylvania suffers more than 1400 gun deaths every year, whether by homicide, suicide or unintentional shootings. PA is  one of a growing number of states where we have more gun deaths than deaths due to automobile accidents.  Our Resource page has fact and stat sheets about gun violence in PA, domestic violence and guns and suicide and firearms.\r\n\r\nConsistent with national data, about 2/3 of  the gun deaths in Pennsylvania are suicides. To learn more about why suicide is a critical part of our gun violence problem, click here.\r\n\r\nClearly, we have a serious problem that demands systemic solutions, focused on regulation, policy, enforcement, economics, education and public health.  Our work focuses on policies related to access to and regulation of firearms, but we also engage in efforts and partnerships to address the other facets required to solve this problem.",

    "description": "CFAR was founded in 1994 under the name, Center for Growth and Development by Maryann C. Volk.  Maryann was a former teacher and principal with the Archdioceses of Philadelphia.  During her tenure she became acutely aware of a growing vacuum between struggling children in school and families struggling to survive in the community.  She witnessed families first hand facing serious issues, ones that required greater support than she was able to provide in the context in which she served them.  Maryann in her 50’s decided to go back to school to obtain a Master’s degree in Marriage and Family Therapy.  Shortly after obtaining her degree, with the purchase of a corner row home, CFAR opened its doors to its first client with one room and one therapist. This row home was where CFAR would spend the next twenty years.\r\n\r\nAs the need for family therapy grew we set out to find our new home.  In July 2016, CFAR closed its doors to the row homes on Magee Avenue and moved into a location double its size on Bustleton Avenue. CFAR although much smaller than most agencies, made a name for ourselves through our unique family systems perspective.  Focusing on the family as a whole has been the key to our success in seeing lasting change in Philadelphia families.\r\n\r\nToday, under current Executive Director Jordan Brogan, CFAR serves an average of 350 families a week and has trained over 100 Marriage and Family Therapists.",

    "description": "We achieve this mission through our after school program, summer camp, and flagship program, “The Goodlands®.”  Centro uses photography, poetry, Bomba (traditional Puerto Rican dance, percussion, and singing), and mural making to assist young people in the Fairhill community to find their voice and creatively express themselves through the arts.\r\n​\r\nCentro’s goal is to offer experiences to Fairhill’s young people that contribute to their success in and out of school. \r\nCentro reaches its goals by: 1) utilizing the project-based learning (PBL) method to engage children in arts and Latino cultural programming; 2) offering homework help; and 3) engaging children’s families and community in programming.\r\n\r\nToday Fairhill is still one of Philadelphia’s most depressed and dangerous neighborhoods: 60% of Fairhill’s residents live below the poverty level; more than 50% of Fairhill’s children do not graduate from high school; and drugs sales are a Fairhill industry. Currently Centro serves more than 100 elementary and middle school children annually and maintains a waiting list. Parents rely on Centro as a safe haven for their children, a resource to help their children understand their homework, and a creative and encouraging environment for their children’s social and emotional growth. Centro’s services are as important now as they were in 1995.",

    "description": "li Winkelman started Challah for Hunger (CfH) as a student at Scripps College in 2004. She missed baking challah with her family, and was looking for a connection to the Jewish community at her school. To solve this, Eli began baking challah with friends, and quickly realized she and her friends could use challah-baking to mobilize and educate others. They began selling the challah and donating the profits to social justice causes. Word of Eli’s project spread, and soon Eli was guiding students, from all corners of the globe, as they started their own CfH chapters.\r\n\r\nA decade after Eli’s first challah sale, CfH continues to thrive. Currently, thousands of Jewish student participants on 80+ campuses across the US, Canada, UK, and Australia gather on a regular basis to continue the centuries-old tradition of baking challah together and practicing tikkun olam in an inclusive environment. For all the volunteers and many of the customers, CfH provides opportunities to be involved in a fun and dedicated community, address humanitarian problems, develop and practice new skills, gain business and leadership experience, and engage in traditions of challah and tzedakah.",

Special teachers include a musician from the community who plays guitar and sings with the children; a yoga instructor who teaches children to find calm while they are learning new movements; and a farmer to support the children in growing and harvesting fresh vegetables and flowers.  \r\n\r\nAs of today, Childspace has created 57 living-wage jobs and serves 210 families in its three centers.

    "description": "Christ Church, the birthplace of the American Episcopal Church, was founded in 1695 as a condition of William Penn’s Charter. Known as “The Nation’s Church,” it hosted members of the Continental Congress during the American Revolution and Presidents George Washington and John Adams in the first decade of the newly established Republic. Among early members were Benjamin and Deborah Franklin, Betsy Ross, John Penn (William Penn’s grandson), and signers of the Constitution and of the Declaration of Independence, including Robert Morris, Benjamin Rush, and Francis Hopkinson.\r\n\r\nDating to 1744, the current building has been cited as “our finest Early American church” and one of the finest Georgian structures in America. Its steeple (1754), financed by a lottery organized by Benjamin Franklin, is the work of Robert Smith, one of America’s earliest architects. For 56 years, the steeple made Christ Church the tallest structure in North America.\r\n\r\nChrist Church is a privately managed historic site that is an official component of Independence National Historical Park. An active Episcopal parish, the church hosts daily historical talks and tours.",

Clients are given sound advice, counsel and direction. Often we provide pro-se coaching in matters clients can handle without representation. We offer clients who qualify with a pro-bono or reduced fee referral to one of our referral attorneys. We also offer spiritual care to clients, both at and after clinic, to those who are interested. We try to offer the love of Jesus to everyone, and seek to help them in any way we can. We have become a lighthouse and a bridge in at-risk neighborhoods, a lighthouse they can come to out of troubled waters, and a bridge to a community of hope, that will care for them. We desire to be part of healing and revival in the city, as we bring diverse people together, urban and suburban, from all churches and racial backgrounds, for a common cause.\r\n\r\nAt our clinics, we handle all types of legal matters including, but not limited to criminal record expungements, wills and powers of attorney.",

    "description": "City Kitties is a small collective of volunteers without any central office or facility. Volunteers rescue cats from the streets and shelters of Philadelphia, provide veterinary care, and find them happy new homes.  When a new stray comes into our care, our intake team notifies potential foster homes and the cats are taken to City Cat Vets for immediate vet care — an exam, FeLV/FIV testing, spay/neuter, vaccinations, and parasite treatment. Once the cats receive a clean bill of health, we place them in one of our dedicated foster homes. We advertise our foster cats online and at outreach venues such as the Clark Park Farmers Market.  City Kitties also collaborates with Baltimore Pet Shoppe, displaying our adoptable kitties in the store window.\r\n\r\nThose interested in adopting fill out an application, let us know which cats they are interested in and, once approved, meet the cats in their foster homes. Once an adopter falls in love with a cat, we arrange transportation, bring the foster cat to its forever home, and provide ongoing support as needed. City Kitties runs entirely on generous donations from Philadelphia residents and beyond. \r\n\r\nCity Kitties is run entirely by volunteers, from our board of directors to our foster homes. We have no paid staff and rely on the generosity of our donors to continue our work.",

Through education and advocacy, CPA championed the need to improve the city’s waterways, bringing to the attention of government and citizen alike, the value of clean and accessible rivers.\r\n\r\nCity Parks Association played major roles in Philadelphia’s urban planning, having \u000bguided the relocation of railroad routes through the City and away from the riverbanks, spearheaded the design and implementation of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, promoted the establishment of the city’s first zoning code and the creation of the City Planning Commission. \r\n\r\nThrough targeted programs and insightful inquiry, the City Parks Association fosters ongoing dialogue and collaborative action among people committed to the stewardship of our city’s natural resources.",

    "description": "The idea for Clara Baldwin Manor was conceived in 1960 way before subsidized senior housing ever existed.  In 1972 Clara Baldwin Manor was the first subsidized senior citizen living quarters built.\r\n\r\nIt was started out of the love Clara Baldwin had for seniors who could no longer afford to maintain their homes.  Starting Clara Baldwin Manor was a godsend to many seniors.\r\n\r\nThe 1970's was a time for promise and hope for urban neighborhoods and communities.  While working with then President Nixon on Civil Rights issues, Mrs Baldwin was asked, what could he do for her?  Mrs. Baldwin said she wanted an apartment building for the senior in her community, so that they could continue to live in the community.",

    "description": "We’ve been around for a bit more than 50 years, about as long as credit cards, and that’s no coincidence. We started out when folks starting learning the hard way about the temptations of credit cards and their unchecked use. Soon came all sorts of easy loans – for cars, schools and houses – and all sorts of reasons why folks couldn’t always keep up with them.\r\n\r\nWe don’t judge how or why people get in hot water; we just want them to get out of it. (Or better yet, keep them away from crisis in the first place.) Our non-profit professionals are pretty good at helping just about anyone set up a household budget, start a savings plan, pay down big loans – even stop a foreclosure and save a house when the mortgage hasn’t been paid for a while.\r\n\r\nWe help people cut through their financial fog to a future of economic clarity. We’re not saying it’s easy; it’s not. But when someone’s on the brink, we have tried-and-true, step-by-step plans to pull them back. \r\n\r\nBest of all, even though we help tens of thousands of people with their personal economics, we’re not in it for the money. We protect people from scams, predatory lenders and consumer rip-offs. We’re proud of our partnerships with United Way and so many other community organizations that advocate for people first. We’re in it for you.",

To achieve scale, it would be necessary to generate Sustainability Intelligence Systems with advanced technologies that permit managers to take smarter decisions. Today, COSA is one of the most respected institutions in its field, serving as the “intel inside” of many corporate and institutional systems to understand sustainability.",

History of science can yield deeper historical perspectives on pressing contemporary issues, and provides a platform for broader public engagement into the sciences.\r\n\r\nThe Consortium brings together educational, cultural and scientific institutions to promote public and academic understanding of the history of science, technology and medicine. The Consortium awards fellowships for researchers, produces events for academics and for the public and provides online resources for teaching, learning and research. The Consortium was established in 2007 as a regional collaboration of eleven institutions in the Philadelphia area. In 2014, the Consortium began to expand across the United States and Canada, welcoming the partners listed below. The Consortium will continue to add new member institutions with exceptional historical resources.",

    "description": "A Chapter 7 bankruptcy can wipe out almost all of your general, unsecured debts such as credit card or medical debt.  For this reason a Chapter 7 bankruptcy can be a powerful poverty fighting tool.  Very few other remedies can eliminate an individual’s financial burden the way a bankruptcy can.  However, filing for bankruptcy can be burdensome and expensive.  Without CBAP’s help many people who would benefit from a bankruptcy are faced with either trying to hire an attorney they can’t afford or trying to go through the complicated process on their own.  Instead, because of our services, these same people will have their financial situation assessed by our supervising attorney and their case referred to a pro bono attorney or law student.  Our volunteers then walk the client through the many steps involved including, but not limited to, gathering all the necessary documents, completing the required forms, as well as advising the client about the debt counseling that is needed or court dates that are scheduled.\r\n\r\nUltimately, CBAP’s goal is to have our clients leave after receiving our services in better, more sustainable financial situations than when they came to us.  By providing both access to the court system and the tools to be financially sustainable our clients are empowered to create better financial futures for themselves and their families.",

It is frequently seen as the “go-to” organization when bias is directed against Muslim individuals or institutions. Its status as the most frequently quoted American Muslim organization in our nation’s media also suggests success in “providing an Islamic perspective on issues of importance to the American public.”",

    "description": "Curio Theatre Company began as a touring and outreach company composed of professional artists and administrators in the Philadelphia region before being incorporated as a non­profit organization in October 2004. In January 2005, Curio joined in partnership with the Calvary Center for Culture and Community at 4740 Baltimore Avenue, Philadelphia. This partnership continues to raise capital to restore the building's once abandoned sanctuary into a professional performing arts venue. In 2012, Curio worked with Calvary to build another performance space in the underused basement of the building. This allowed Curio to expand its production season, and gave our education department more room to hold classes throughout the year.\r\n\r\nSince 2004, our programming has consisted of productions and education. On average we produce four shows a year for the public. Beyond our productions, we also run a theatre school for the local West Philadelphia students, as well as a theatre camp that runs throughout July. In 2015, the Education Department introduced a new program called Curiositeens. This is a free program for local teenagers that runs throughout the school year, and offers the students a chance to go deeper into their theatrical training.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to serve the West Philadelphia Community, and we look forward to providing our community with affordable theatrical opportunities in the years to come!",

    "description": "Da Vinci Art Alliance (DVAA) was founded in 1931 by sixteen Italian immigrant artists and collectors at a time when immigrants were barred from major artistic, academic, and scientific institutions. DVAA was a creative refuge where members could show their works, hold meetings, engage in social activities, and offer intellectual and cultural exchanges and events. Together, they chose as their namesake the master of the Italian Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci.  \r\n\r\nDVAA permanently moved to 704 Catharine St. in South Philadelphia in 1966. Since then, the building has housed artist studios and exhibitions annually. \r\n\r\nIn 2015, DVAA hired its first full-time Executive Director to improve the Artist Membership program. DVAA’s Artist Membership program now offers several annual exhibition opportunities for artists and critically engaged programs monthly. To build community within Philadelphia, DVAA has created a Fellowship program for underserved artists, designed an annual community art and science festival called Da Vinci Fest, and installed a permanent mural on our building.",

Its goals are to spread awareness to all communities of the growing epidemic and how to combat and destigmatize it, to offer advice to families struggling with a family member currently afflicted, to console families who have lost a loved one to the disease and ultimately, to raise monies to assist in the operation of the Daniel J. Orens Center for Life, a collaborative of several non-profit organizations operating a resource center for returning citizens located in Wynnefield Pa.",

All officers, directors, advisors and fundraising committee members donate their time, effort and expertise.\r\n\r\nThrough monies generated from fundraisers and general contributions from benevolent donors, the Foundation will play an integral role to provide assistance and guidance for those struggling with the battle of drug addiction. We believe that with the help and support of others, the Foundation along with the Center for Life will help save lives and restore families. The further we can spread Dan’s message, the more people we can help and the more lives we can save. We will continue our tireless efforts to assure that Dan’s amazing, caring and unique magnetism lives on as an Inspiration from Beyond to all.",

    "description": "In 2013, Darren was diagnosed with Glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive form of brain cancer. Rather than giving into the disease, Darren sought to help others by forming The Darren Daulton Foundation with his wife Amanda. The Darren Daulton Foundation was born out of Darren’s love and inspiration for serving and helping others. The Foundation serves as an extension of Darren’s love for people. The way in which he lived every day.\r\n\r\nWe have all been impacted by Darren one way or another. Whether you were a baseball player, a close friend or a devoted fan, Darren treated you like family. Even with all the fanfare and publicity that surrounded Darren, at the core he was humble and put others before himself. This is why he chose to use his notoriety to bring awareness and funding to this disease.\r\n\r\nAfter a courageous battle, Darren passed away from his bout with cancer on August 6, 2017.  Although Darren is no longer with us, his spirit lives on through the Foundation, which is committed to providing financial assistance to those who suffer from malignant primary brain tumors. The Board of Directors, together with Amanda Daulton, vow to continue supporting those who are affected by this devastating disease and raising awareness for brain cancer.\r\n\r\nSince its inception the Darren Daulton Foundation has granted over $250,000.00 to more than 100 people",

One graduate is the Resident Coordinator and the other is her assistant.

The in-house therapist provides trauma-informed counseling both individually and in group sessions.\r\n\r\nDawn’s Place provides a safe, non-judgmental environment to up to eight women affected by CSE. We offer a year-long residential program. Each resident works with a social worker to develop a plan for recovery, moving through the program in phases designed to methodically and simultaneously increase responsibility for themselves, their future, and the community which enables them to build a sense of freedom and empowerment. Our holistic program includes trauma-informed therapy, peer mentor support, art and music therapy, mindfulness instruction, access to health care, education, legal assistance, life and social skills coaching, career training, finding housing, and access to a fitness area. We connect residents dealing with addiction or mental health issues with off-site intensive outpatient programs. As women progress through the program, the skills they acquire become self-sustaining, allowing them to become drug-free, sober, employed and able to live independently.",

    "description": "Originally incorporated as the Delaware Valley Lyric Opera Guild, DVOC was started in 1979. The intention of its founders was to offer a stepping stone for singers, providing training and education through exposure to all facets of operatic production, and performance opportunities in a variety of operas. During the first year, two operas and a concert were produced at various Center City locations while a permanent space was sought.\r\n\r\nIn 1981, the Company discovered the Hermitage Mansion, one of Philadelphia's historic Fairmount Park homes, and began to lease it from the City. A year later, an outdoor stage was built in the natural amphitheater behind the Mansion and became the Paul D. Osimo Outdoor Theatre. The Mansion served as the Company's administrative base, rehearsal space, costume and scenery storage site, and the location for its Winter Concert Series in the living room. The mansion is no longer used by DVOC. The company has performed in several venues in the Philadelphia area since leaving the mansion in 2008. Currently DVOC performs at the Venice Island Performing Arts and Recreation Center in Manayunk.",

(DVSF) is a forum for middle and high school students to display to display scientific research and engineering projects that they have completed.  During the fair the competitors will be interviewed and have their research evaluated. The primary goals are that the students will gain some insight into new directions for their research, learn new ways of thinking, and, in some cases, be connected with people who could help bring a potential product to market. All of this takes the form of a competition with winners receiving recognition, scholarships, and monetary prizes, as well as a chance to compete in the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair.\r\n\r\nMany of our competitors go on to some of the top colleges and universities followed by careers in STEM. Many of our past competitors have credited the work that they did for DVSF and the feedback that they received from our judges with starting them on their path. It has been proven that the \"inquiry-based hands-on\" approach to learning STEM is effective. In fact, \"inquiry\" is now a top priority in the state educational standards for Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. \r\n\r\n​",

Throughout the years, thousands of teachers, parents, children and youth have benefited from ECP’s programs. ECP reaches out to families from a wide cross-section of socio-economic backgrounds throughout the Greater Philadelphia area to teach them basic principles and values of parenting. These principles and values are not only necessary to become a good parent, they are critical to shaping a responsible society.\r\n\r\nThe foundation for all ECP programs is a researched-based curriculum originally developed in 1979 and continually updated to reflect new findings, evaluation feedback, and to meet the needs of new client populations. This curriculum has been used by organizations and workshops across the country. Because of Ms. Scattergood’s visionary leadership over 30 years ago, ECP has grown to become a leader in the field of parenting education providing services for nearly 2,000 students annually.",

Education Plus Health is committed to improving access to high quality healthcare and driving better educational outcomes for underserved communities. The school-based health centers provide two models of primary care, one embedded within school nursing, both delivered by licensed and certified nurse practitioners in the school environment. Education Plus Health is the emerging Pennsylvania affiliate of the national School-Based Health Alliance, the voice for school-based health care since 1995.

FHRC was founded by Dr. Mari K. Fielder, a professor and mother who realized the need for fair housing advocacy for women with children, and Marlene Craven, a disability rights advocate. In May of 2007, FHRC changed its name from the Fair Housing Council of Montgomery County to the Fair Housing Rights Center in Southeastern Pennsylvania to more accurately reflect the geographic area reached.\r\n\r\nFHRC works cooperatively and collectively with other fair housing agencies to provide innovative and effective services to the public for the prevention and elimination of housing discrimination throughout the Greater Philadelphia region.",

Over the years, the centers have helped thousands of families find and keep homes, learn English, be trained to gain and keep employment, enhance their children’s educational achievement, recognize and encourage many exceptional young people, and work towards having safer and more nurturing environments for all their fellow neighbors.

Programming initiatives support the mission and vision of the organization, continuing a close association with the Olde Fort Mifflin Historical Society.\r\n\r\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the British Army bombarded and captured the fort as part of their conquest of Philadelphia in autumn 1777. The United States Army began to rebuild the fort in 1794 and continued to garrison and build on the site through the 19th century. It housed prisoners during the American Civil War. The army decommissioned Fort Mifflin in 1962 and returned it to the City of Philadelphia. Historic preservationists have restored the fort.",

Some highlights include the International Chinese New Year Parade in Hong Kong (2007), a march down Main Street USA in the “SpectoMagic” Parade in Disney World (2007), a trip to Ireland to perform in 2002, the 2003 Pennsylvania Governor (Ed Rendell) Inauguration Parade, several Miss America Pageant Parades, Milwaukee Circus Parade, West Virginia Strawberry Festivals, Bristol Rhode Island’s Fourth of JulyCelebration, Virginia Apple Blossom and Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parades, Holyoke, Massachusetts’ Saint Patrick Day parade and a concert at the Congressional Building in Washington, D.C. In 1973, Mayor Moon Landrieu and the City of New Orleans invited Fralinger to the Mardi Gras, and the band was honored with top prize as the best musical organization. \r\n\r\nSince 1914, it has been a pleasure for many generations of Fralinger members to perform and delight audiences of all ages. We hope this tradition of Philadelphia Mummery and Fralinger entertainment excellence continues well into the 21st century.",

The environment our school provides is one in which our students feel safe enough to take the risks necessary for learning. By providing a safe place and encouraging individuality, students achieve both academic and emotional growth that prepares them for the challenges they will face in college and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere at Freire empowers each student to grow, both inside and outside the classroom. By engaging with our community, our students apply the skills and knowledge they acquire with Freire to create new possibilities for our futures. Because of our high standards and our commitment to each individual student’s potential, we are closing the gap between educational experiences that may have failed our children in the past and the incredible opportunities that lie ahead.\r\n\r\nAt Freire Charter School, we are building the future, one student at a time. nd.",

At every age, students visit museums, attend cultural events, participate in community service, and use the finest educational resources Philadelphia has to offer. Through interaction with the real world, students become resourceful learners and active citizens of our school, city, and global community.\r\n\r\nOur Pre-K through 12 academic program is an engaging and connected educational journey. It’s carefully constructed to guide students through every stage of learning in a warm and welcoming environment where failure is not feared or believed to be fixed. At the core is a firm foundation of Quaker values. During weekly Meeting for Worship, our students and teachers sit in silent search for Truth and if moved to speak, rise to share. Seniors graduate from Friends Select with the knowledge and understanding of peaceful resolution to conflict, empathy, service to others, mutual respect, inclusion, and stewardship",

    "description": "After years of informal volunteer efforts, a small group of community-minded citizens had a vision of a safer and cleaner Penn Treaty Park. In 2005, we created a grass-roots effort to preserve and promote the park as a positive green space for family and community.\r\n\r\nThe Friends of Penn Treaty Park began by overseeing refurbishments of park monuments, as well as the addition of new benches and playground equipment. We have been able to cover the cost of the replacement of the Treaty tree and decorative fencing around it. We are working on funding future improvements, including lighting and enhancements to the children’s area.\r\n\r\nToday, we have grown into a regional community of members and volunteers dedicated to protecting and enhancing the park. In order to continue to keep the park in tip-top shape and improve it, we need our friends to continue to support our efforts through membership contributions. As Fairmount Park Commission receives less funds than it has in previous years, Penn Treaty Park’s support will also suffer. That is where your membership contribution comes in.

The Park offers multiple active recreation activities with a baseball diamond/soccer field and tennis/basketball courts. Open paved areas have served novice bike learners, kickball/volleyball leagues, and bike polo enthusiasts. Children are served by the Markward Playground and O’Connor Pool. Dog owners have access to the largest dog runs in Center City. Neighborhood Gardeners have a large community garden of individual plots. The entire Park serves as a passive natural park area with distinct small and large scale green areas. And Markward Public Recreation Center is the heart of the Park from which summer camps, after school programs, and other community classes and programs are offered to city and neighborhood residents alike.\r\n\r\nFSRP recognizes the value of public space. As our most recent Master Plan outlines, Schuylkill River Park plays a significant role in the daily lives of thousands of Philadelphia residents. Because of its central location within the city, its connectivity to the community and other parks, and its unique amenities, this Park draws a diverse set individuals and groups that visit for a multitude of reasons. The paths, benches, grounds and places within our Park have been the backdrop for many personal memories and collective experiences. Residents both close and far have profound relationships to our Park that go back several generations.",

    "description": "Saint Malach100_4683y School was founded in 1860 to serve the large population of Irish immigrants in North Philadelphia.  The current school building was built in 1891 at the direction of then pastor (later Archbishop) Edmond Prendergast.  The school’s faculty was initially comprised of Sisters of Mercy. In the early days of the school, boys and girls were educated separately.  Under the direction of Mother M. Edmonda Prendergast, calisthenics and elocution were introduced to the curriculum.  Mother Prendergast was also the first principal to have a graduation ceremony for eighth grade students.\r\n\r\nAt the turn of the century Saint Malachy School served 600 students.  Most students went off to work after eighth grade but some attend high schools such as Roman Catholic High School for Boys and Catholic Girls High (now Hallahan).  The 20th century brought many changes to the school.  Most of the Irish families moved from the neighborhood and a large number of African Americans migrated from the south.  More lay faculty members taught at the school and the Sisters of Mercy ended their time at Saint Malachy School in 1992.\r\n\r\nDespite changing demographics and challenges during the past 153 years, Saint Malachy School has remained an anchor in the community and continues its tradition of providing a quality education rooted in Catholic values to the children of North Philadelphia.",

Friends of UNIFAT is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization committed to supporting the educational and peace building initiatives of the Upper Nile Institute for Appropriate Technology or UNIFAT. UNIFAT is a private primary school located in Gulu, Uganda in East Africa.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1985 by Mrs. Abitimo Rebecca Odongkara, UNIFAT formed under humble beginnings with just a few students who received lessons under a tree. Mrs. Odongkara, who only a few years early had fled with her family to the United States due to the violent dictatorship of Idi Amin, decided to return to Uganda to help children left destitute due to war, displacement and the HIV/AIDS crisis.\r\n\r\nDespite these challenges, UNIFAT grew from that tree and became one of the best schools in the region, serving as a beacon of hope and a symbol of excellence in Northern Uganda. Today, UNIFAT School serves students from kindergarten through primary seven (the equivalent of eighth grade in the United States). UNIFAT’s uniqueness comes from its mission of “learning through love and understanding,” and its desire to not just educate children but to instill the values of love and peace.",

We created, tested, and developed on-screen tutorials that guide a senior step-by step with age-friendly instructions in large type and plain English, respectfully and clearly.\r\n \r\nWe provide PC and tablet training in two ways — to institutions and to individuals. For institutions that serve seniors, we offer a web-based version of both the tablet and PC training programs. The tablet training, pioneered with the Philadelphia Corporation for Aging and funded by the Pennsylvania Department on Aging, is a comprehensive program called a Sip & Swipe Café®. We have served nearly 2000 facilities, including assisted living and retirement centers, HUD subsidized housing, senior centers and public libraries.\r\n\r\nFor individuals, caregivers, and families, we provide our tablet training through apps in both the Apple App store and Android Google Play store. We also have developed tutorials that simplify the Internet for seniors seeking specific tasks — from the Medicare Part D Plan Finder to the Social Security website. We pioneered a Workforce Development training program for institutions that helps retirees who need to learn how to find part-time employment online, as newspaper ads disappear and most applications require digital submission.",

During the weekend, Jackie and the other bloggers posted photos, tweets, and other updates about their experience together, and the response was overwhelming!\r\n\r\nWomen across the nation, and the globe, wanted to share in an experience like this. So, Jackie worked to start a website and organization that unites some of the best lady IBD bloggers, as a way to show the world that even pretty people get IBD. And Girls With Guts was born.\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve held annual retreats from Texas to Pennsylvania, with 5 Year celebration event in Chicago and now host one additional event a year that is fully-sponsored! These events are where our sisterhood was born, blossomed, and has continued to flourish.",

People in conflict come to the Mediation Program to resolve their disputes through mediation.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly 100 years of service to delinquent/dependent youth, Good Shepherd Corporation phased out its youth residential programs. In 1982, a needs assessment of the 14th and 35th police districts in Northwest Philadelphia was conducted to identify community concerns. It became apparent that crime and violence resulting from escalating, unresolved disputes - particularly involving youth - were the social problems about which community residents were most concerned. In 1984, Good Shepherd Neighborhood House was established as Philadelphia's first neighborhood justice center, serving the 14th and 35th police districts. Good Shepherd Mediation Program currently offers mediation, and training and consulting services to the Greater Philadelphia area. In 2016, the Mediation Program moved to the Museum area to be more centrally located.\r\n\r\nGood Shepherd uses a voluntary mediation process designed to resolve interpersonal and community conflicts peacefully.",

    "description": "Our Goals are threefold. First, we serve to grow the local film and video industry in every way possible, recognizing its huge economic impact in job creation and its unparalleled public relations effects for the region. Second, we serve to attract film & video production to the region, including everything from feature films to TV commercials to music videos and industrial films. Finally, we provide the producer free assistance with parking, permits, labor, and locations, and generally act as the liaison between the production and the local community, cutting red tape as we go. A non-profit economic development agency committed to the growth of the regional film and video production industry, GPFO has been responsible for impacting the local economy with nearly $6B since 1992.",

Inspired by the “effortless excellence” that Haile exhibited professionally and personally, her family created the HLA Foundation to ensure youth have access to positive examples, role models, and experiences that will both inspire and encourage excellence. Haile’s own inspiration to enter a career in law, a chance conversation with a female attorney that planted the seed “I could do that too”, led to history being made when Haile became the first African-American female Superior Court judge in Delaware in 1992. This shows the power of exposure, example and inspiration. \r\n\r\nWe strive to provide positive experiences in academics, cultural exploration and community service.  We see the benefits of our involvement in the lives of our students continually. Since participating in our programming, we have witnessed increased reading comprehension, improved grades on report cards, and a rise in overall confidence of the students. Additionally, the behavior of students we’ve worked with has been drastically improved vs. the general school population as a result of having a caring community’s guidance, encouragement, discipline and support.",

In addition, we run a nationally recognized program, the Jewish Graduate Student Network, that supports over 3,000 graduate students from across the region. Unfortunately, these Hillels have been underserved and under-resourced for way too long, and we’re here to ensure that every student has access to a thriving Jewish community.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to supporting each and every Jewish student on campus. We aim to create a vibrant Jewish community that provides opportunities for diverse forms of Jewish expression through an exciting array of activities throughout the school year. Whether it’s a coffee date with one of our Hillel professionals, a Shabbat dinner, an educational program or any of our hundreds of programs throughout the year, we believe that creating meaningful Jewish experiences for college students fosters an enduring connection to Jewish life in our community's future leaders.",

William partnered with Philadelphia’s first printer, purchased a 20-acre plot of land along Paper Mill Run (a tributary of the Wissahickon Creek) and, with the help of his son Nicholas, built the first paper mill in British North America that otherwise could only be delivered from England.

    "description": "The House of Umoja began operating in Philadelphia during the 1970’s as a unique grassroots program initiated by community residents David and Falaka Fattah (National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, 1999; see also Woodson, 1981, 1986, 1998). Using their own resources and their home as a base of operations, they created this family-centered community institution that effectively mediated gang conflicts and came to serve as a source of counsel and individual development for neighborhood gang and nongang youth. The family model “provides a sense of belonging, identity, and self-worth that was previously sought through gang membership” (National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, 1999:59). Through reparenting  and providing role models, the House of Umoja has “successfully transformed more than five hundred frightened, frustrated, and alienated young minority males into self-assured, competent, concerned, and productive citizens” (National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, 1999:16).",

We maintain a very low tuition with a good scholarship program so that Christian education can be accessible to the poor in our community.  We have tutoring for students who enter the school behind their grade level.  Our students have made great progress academically since implementing the Foundations & Frameworks material into our overall curriculum in 2006.  And since most of our students are not raised in Christian homes, we do all we can to train them up in the ways of the Lord.  Many of them have heard the gospel of Jesus Christ for the first time at HPCA and have come to know the Lord.  Some students have been influential in bringing their parents to church.  \r\n\r\nWe serve approximately 200 children, pre-kindergarten through eighth grade.  We are members of PACS (Philadelphia Association of Christian Schools) and the Street School Network.  We are accredited by the Middle States Commission on Elementary Education.",

Over 7 weeks on Sundays for two hours, kids will be instructed in the game of lacrosse through drills the first hour and then play the game for the second hour.\r\n​\r\nThe other powerful aspect of Inner City Lacrosse is the use of collegiate lacrosse players as volunteers to instruct and coach these kids during the fall when they are not in their season.  This framework allows collegiate lacrosse players to be good ambassadors for their school and for the sport of lacrosse.
