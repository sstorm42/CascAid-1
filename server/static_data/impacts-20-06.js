        Title: "Across the country, our right to abortion is under attack. A growing number of states are banning abortion outright. And since 2010, others have quietly passed more than 400 restrictions on abortion care.\n\nThis is all part of a nationwide assault aimed at overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nWhat we're seeing now is an accelerated version of an anti-abortion playbook that we've seen for decades: politicians pushing abortion care out of reach, shutting down clinics, and threatening to throw women and providers in jail.\n\nWe've been here before. We didn't back down then, and we certainly won't now.\n\nAs long as you're with us, we'll keep fighting to defend and expand access to abortion care. In the courts, we're fighting state abortion bans like those in Alabama, Ohio, and Kentucky � with more to come. We're fighting dozens of other state restrictions designed to shut down clinics and create obstacles to care.\n\nWe're not content just playing defense, either, and are working to expand abortion rights wherever we can: In states like New York, Illinois, and Maine, activists like you helped pass bills that declare abortion to be a fundamental right.\n\nThis is a long, uphill fight about the right to make decisions about our healthcare, our own bodies, and our lives. But together we can defend this right. Together we can win.\n\nAre you with us?",

As with most of our programs, these Bigs and Littles spend time together 2 � 4 times each month.\n\nFor additional information and details about our Community Based Mentoring Programs, please contact: Bigs@independencebigs.org',

        Description:
            'The PA legislature has the chance to do something that makes sense and saves lives: enact an extreme risk protection order bill. This bill creates a civil court process family members and law enforcement can use to temporarily bar access to firearms by a family member at risk of harming himself or others. Over a dozen states have this type of process, and it is preventing suicides, and likely homicides and mass shootings.  ERPO is another tool families can use to make sure their loved ones can stay safe at times of crisis.\n\nThink about it: family usually knows first when something is wrong and can spot warning signs in a loved one�s behavior. Ask your Representative to sign on to HB 1075, joining Republicans and Democrats across the Commonwealth in working to bring this commonsense measure to a vote.\n\nWe need this law. It makes sense and will save lives.  Ask your Representative to be part of the solution and sign on to HB 1075.',

The U.S is far behind the rest of the world when it comes to protecting children and their rights and this needs to change. 196 countries have signed the CRC. The U.S. has NOT.\n\nThe Trump Administration�s zero-tolerance policy resulting in the separation of children from parents at the border is the straw that breaks the camel�s back. It proves that the U.S. now needs to ratify the CRC. The images of the suffering children at the hands of U.S. government officials are the wake-up call America needs to finally do the right thing.\n\nOver the span of six weeks, at least 2,300 children were separated from their parents and other family members at the border by the government.  These children had little recourse against this abuse, because the United States has never ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nSign this petition to urge the United States Senate to finally ratify the UN Convention for the Rights of the Child and make our government think twice before it endangers children again.',

We pay for 100% of veterinary care, answer your questions about health and behavior, and screen applications from potential adopters. You will make a great foster parent if:\n\nyou are flexible, patient, and love animals!\n\nyou live in the general vicinity of West Philly, South Philly, Center City, Fairmount/Brewerytown, or Northern Liberties/Fishtown. We need foster homes to be close to us, as well as our veterinarian and potential adopters.\n\n*you are comfortable providing minor health care, with guidance from City Kitties (oral and topical medications, flea/tick preventatives, grooming, etc.) and to assist with follow-up vet visits for your foster animal.\n* your pets are up-to-date on appropriate medical care, cats tested for FIV/FeLV, and spayed/neutered.\n*your current cats live indoors at all times and your home is safe for cats/kittens (screens on all windows, kitten-proof where applicable, etc.).\n* you are willing to provide food, litter, and basic living costs (City Kitties pays for 100% of medical care).\n* you have regular access to a car (your own, a friend�s, or car share) � this is not required but very helpful.\n* you are easy to get in touch with by email and phone and can respond quickly to schedule meetings with potential adopters.\n* you can say goodbye to your adopted foster feline when they find a happy forever home, so that another life can be saved. We understand that sometimes foster parents just can�t bear to part with their foster animals, but we encourage volunteers to let them go � this means we can pull another homeless kitty from the streets or shelter.\n* you can commit to at least a few months (preferably 6 months or more) as a volunteer. Foster cats remain in our care for as little as 2 weeks and as long as 2 years! We keep them for as long as it takes to find the right forever home. Though we occasionally need emergency/short-term foster placements, the longer you can provide a stable home for a formerly homeless feline, the better.',

        Description:
            'Whetstone Run in Marple Township, Delaware County is one of the last remaining high quality streams in the Darby Creek Valley Watershed (DCVA). This Tuesday, April 20, 2021, the Pennsylvania Environmental Quality Board (EQB) is scheduled to vote not to protect this important stream.\n\nWe need to act now to demand the EQB withhold their vote until further studies are completed.\n\nIn 2017, DCVA petitioned the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to upgrade the designation of an unnamed tributary to Whetstone Run from Warm Water Fishery (WWF)/Migratory Fishery (MF) to High Quality � Warm Water Fishes, Migratory Fishes (HQ-WWF, MF). Such a re-designation would afford the creek additional special protections from pollution and development. DEP is currently recommending �no change� and no special protections for this important headwater forested stream. However, in its initial investigation of the stream, DEP:\n\nFailed to include three years of macroinvertebrate data provided by DCVA.\nFailed to use accurate local comparison streams.\nChose �reference� sample locations in streams with significantly larger watersheds (2,432 acres) than the Southern Tributary�s watershed (166.4 acres), leading to comparisons that are technically unsound.  \nFailed to address DCVA�s comments addressing these errors during the open comment period.\nWe have mere days to act to urge the EQB to deny DEP�s recommendation for �no change� to Whetstone Run�s status. \n\nTake action now and urge members of the EQB to withhold their vote, and send the application back to DEP for further technical analysis.\n\nWhetstone Run is the highest functioning stream in the Darby Creek Valley watershed; losing it due to an incorrect Water Quality designation would be a significant loss for the watershed. The EQB should not accept the recommendation of �no change� based on the Department�s accompanying report. The review period for this petition has been relatively brief, and rulemaking action on it is premature. There is no need for a rapid decision based on questionable information. Serious technical issues remain outstanding, which the DEP needs to explain.',

        Title: 'SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE ADELPHIA GATEWAY PIPELINE�S WATER PERMITS',
        Description:
            'Adelphia Gateway, LLC (Adelphia) is currently seeking approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to amend a water-related permit for the Adelphia Gateway pipeline project. This permit, called a Chapter 102 � Erosion and Sediment Control permit, is required for construction activities that disturb the surface of the land, including the development of pipelines and related facilities like compressor stations. Adelphia proposes to expand the area under construction for this natural gas pipeline project at nine locations along its route by a total of 4.5 acres.\n\nAdelphia�s application fails to explain why it actually needs to impact so much more land and doesn�t show whether these proposed modifications actually meet the permit�s requirements. Additionally, Adelphia plans to expand it�s construction areas on portions of the Schuylkill River trail, but it�s unclear how these new plans will impact public access and enjoyment of the trail. Also, DEP only posted the application materials online for public review on April 6th, with just 6 days left in the designated 30-day comment period. This did not provide the public an adequate amount of time to review the necessary materials and develop meaningful comments.\n\nTake action now by calling on DEP to require Adelphia to submit additional application materials addressing these key issues before granting any further permits. Also, urge DEP to extend the current comment period to allow the public a full and fair opportunity to participate in this review process. We encourage you to modify our sample comment to raise any additional issues or concerns. The deadline for public comments is Monday, April 13th at 11:59pm.',

Project applicants should not be able to obtain permit waivers for Pennsylvania�s most critical streams and wetlands regardless of their size.  \n\nAdditionally, the proposed regulations would change the permit application submission process for large projects, such as pipelines, which cross multiple counties, by only requiring applicants to submit one application, rather than needing to submit applications to each county the project touches. The EQB needs to make sure that any proposed revisions do not hinder the county�s role in the project review.

Everyone gets to enjoy the meal and company AND everyone feels great helping a very worthy cause.\nYou can also provide printed material as well by downloading and printing the brochures to the right. More brochures coming soon.\nYou might also consider: a girls night out, ballroom dancing night, fashion show, sporting events and competitions, zoo day, family fun day, balloon-grams, canoe trip, craft night, club night, door prizes, ice carving competition, knitting competition, pub crawl, pet show, quilting bee, rally, swear box, spelling bee, talent contest, treasure hunt, yo-yo competition, yodeling competition. The possibilities are endless!\nPlease collect names and email addresses of people in attendance who would like to join our mailing list!

        Description:
            'The Mwangaza seminars are made possible each year thanks to secondary teachers from the United States who are willing to volunteer their time and expertise to the mission. Since 1996, teachers from the United States and\nTanzania have come together to explore research-based teaching strategies and develop lesson planning techniques to easily adopt those strategies into their everyday curriculum.\n\nVolunteers work alongside seminar attendees to teach and guide as partners in an educational journey. The focus of a seminar frequently shifts when new needs arise, so volunteers must be flexible to meet the ever-changing needs of Tanzanian teachers.\n\nCurrently, we require that all teacher volunteers meet the following criteria:\n1. Trained, or willing to be trained, in Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP)\n2. Able to designate one long weekend to face-to-face or online SIOP review\n3. Owns or can purchase Making Content Comprehensible for Secondary English Learners: The SIOP Model with the CD-ROM\n4. Able to fund a 2-week trip to Tanzania during the summer. The trip typically costs around $3,000. Volunteers can stay on-site at the Mwangaza Hostel and Guesthouse.',

            'From a practice standpoint, MAP utilizes the law as an instrument of mental health healing through the provision of free legal services to veterans from all branches of service thus eliminating barriers to top-notch representation that would otherwise be inaccessible due to affordability. Since its founding, MAP has provided Pro Bono bankruptcy representation to hundreds of service members.\n\nDiversifying our practice area offerings from 1 to 8; today, MAP�s work includes filing Chapter 7 bankruptcies, marking IRS accounts non-collectible (i.e. for separated service members struggling to obtain employment), making Offers in Compromise on past due IRS liabilities, appealing VA benefit decisions, requesting waivers for VA and DoD overpayments, discharge upgrades on bad paper, and Camp LeJeune water contamination claims.\n\nThe Consumer Law Division at Military Assistance Project provides free legal services to veterans and active service members facing financial crisis. Volunteer legal professionals will provide services to clients with consumer debt and tax issues. Analysis is conducted to determine whether a client would be better served by some financial planning or through Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. If filing for bankruptcy would provide the client with a fresh start, MAP volunteers will work with the client on the preparation and filing of the petition. MAP volunteers also accompany clients to the 341(a) Meeting of Creditors and provide other services necessary in connection with obtaining the discharge in bankruptcy including motions to avoid liens. In extraordinary circumstances, MAP attorneys may represent clients in an adversary proceeding, but all MAP bankruptcy clients are no-asset clients so these proceedings are atypical. \n\nVeterans Administrative Law covers all benefits provided by the US Department of Veterans Affairs as well as discharge upgrades within the individual military departments (Department of the Air Force, Department of the Army, or Department of the Navy). Legal representation in applying for these benefits provides immeasurable assistance in getting veterans access to benefits which they may not have been able to get on their own. The areas of practice within Veterans Administrative Law provide the greatest assistance to homeless and low-income veterans. Not only will a volunteer be able to help someone who put their life on the line in service to our nation, but some of these veterans have amazing stories that they love to tell.',

This is your opportunity to get to know our riders!\n\nIn addition, volunteers help groom and tack the horses before the lessons start. After lessons, you might also help out feeding the horses and settling them in for the night after a good day�s work.\n\nInitially, everyone is trained as a side-walker, which involves walking alongside the rider to ensure his/her safety. Instructors might also ask side-walkers to assist them in activities with the rider. Other responsibilities include grooming and tacking the horses before lessons and helping to keep the barn, arenas, and grounds tidy.\n\nVolunteers who have been with us for 3 months or more can complete the horse handler training. Our horse handlers are responsible for leading horses during lessons and handling them when they are in the barn and in the pastures. \n\nOur lessons require up to 12 volunteers per lesson day. Volunteers will be asked to sign up for a lesson block or communicate availability with our volunteer coordinator',

PVS visitors come from all walks of life, and we are always looking to expand our network of prison visitors. Foreign language ability is an asset, and we are always looking for individuals with unique gifts that they can share with the entire PVS community.\n \nFor PVS, just twelve days a year can truly make a difference in the lives of prisoners. Visitation, including preliminary correspondence and follow-up reporting, requires the equivalent of one day a month, and visitors are offered constant support through the PVS office and our network of visitors. Orientation, training, and follow-up services are provided for all visitors, and they remain in close contact with our National Office for as long as they serve.',

            "Rock Ministries is a ministry of Jesus in a place where His life and His love are desperately needed. Jesus is not only our Savior, but our Lord as well, and when we surrender ourselves to Him, He can accomplish much through us. Prayerfully  consider where the Lord is directing you by His Word. If He is leading you to serve at The Rock, then we will invite you to explore opportunities here. \n\nThe best way to volunteer is to come to a Sunday service at 11:00 am, and talk with one of our pastors or elders. They will let you know what types of service positions are needed, whether it be childcare, after school programs, building maintenance, or street outreach. And they will also let you know just how to go about volunteering. If it's not possible to make it to the Sunday service please fill out the form below and we will contact you.",

We have many opportunities for volunteer attorneys to join our work and help provide legal services to older Pennsylvanians in need in areas of law in which they have experience or have attended training. Attorneys who join the SeniorLAW Center panel provide representation in any of a wide range of legal matters, ranging from transactional to litigation. Our staff is available for guidance and we provide regular trainings. We also have a great need for bilingual attorneys.\n\nHere are some of the pro bono opportunities SeniorLAW Center offers to volunteer attorneys:\n\nHandle an individual case for a low-income senior, from litigation to transactional, eviction to grandparent custody, probate, elder financial exploitation, mortgage foreclosure or dozens of other areas of law critical to seniors� lives. We handle many different types of cases in a variety of courts and venues. We receive over 150 calls each week for help.\nProvide limited representation services to older Pennsylvanians through our PA SeniorLAW HelpLine, 1-877-PA SR LAW (1-877-727-7529), where we offer free legal advice, counsel, some brief services, information and referrals to seniors in all 67 counties of the Commonwealth. After completing our training, return phone calls to PA older adults from your own office on topics within your areas of expertise and experience at times selected by you to fit within your schedule. We receive calls from all 67 counties in PA in all areas of civil law.\nHelp with systemic reform, from researching best practices in elder justice across the nation, drafting legislation, testimony, or educational brochures on changes in the law, to filing and helping to lead impact litigation.\nYour firm can create a practice group in a particular area of poverty law for seniors. We provide training and ongoing guidance and support as well as the cases. Groups often meet periodically to share challenges and successes. Existing practice groups include contractor fraud, landlord/tenant, probate, deed transfers.\nHold or participate in a �life planning� clinic to draft simple advance planning documents, focused on health care and financial decision-making.\nCreate a special community-based project, including direct service or community education, to address unmet needs.\nSeniorLAW Center provides substantive training throughout the year and staff experts are available to guide volunteers. We are always happy to explore other ideas as well to meet the interests and passions of your organization.

        Description:
            "The workers are the backbone of the Weekend; without them, none of it would be possible. Volunteering at the Weekend can be hard work, but it can be fun, too! To get started, go ahead and read the information below about volunteering. If you're think you're interested, please fill out our Volunteer Form.\n\nHere's some background on SisterSpace's volunteer culture and what you can expect as a volunteer:\nSisterspace is planned and executed entirely by volunteers. Volunteering is a great way for women who want to have a positive impact on our Weekend community to meet new people and get more involved. Volunteers are expected to commit 12 to 16 hours of time working at the Weekend in exchange for a greatly reduced admission fee. Most positions will require you to arrive Thursday afternoon or evening, and some may require that you stay until Monday morning). Volunteers are also cordially invited to attend our worker-only \"Thanksgiving get-together\" Sunday evening after the close of the festival; it's a delicious way to relax and celebrate another successful Weekend with your fellow volunteers.\n\nVolunteering can be hard work, and it's vital to the success of the Weekend. We need people who are truly interested in pitching in to make the Weekend function, and are willing to commit to showing up and fulfilling their role to the best of their ability. If your sole reason for volunteering is for the reduced admission, we strongly suggest that you consider applying for a scholarship instead.\n\nSo - let's recap:\n\nFor most positions, volunteers are required to work 12 to 16 hours during the course of the weekend in exchange for steeply discounted festival admission, lodging, meals, etc.\nVolunteers contribute $110 toward their registration.\nVolunteers are not required to submit a $50 workshift deposit.\nMost positions require volunteers to arrive Thursday afternoon or evening, and some may require volunteers to stay until Monday morning.\nVolunteers are invited to attend our \"Thanksgiving get-together\" Sunday evening at the close of the festival.",

        Description:
            'Across the country, the shortage of healthcare providers, including hospitalists, has hindered how effectively we can respond to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act (H.R. 2255/S. 1024) seeks to enhance the healthcare workforce during the COVID-19 global pandemic by recapturing 40,000 unused immigrant visas for foreign doctors (15,000) and nurses (25,000), as well as visas for their spouse and children. It also requires the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State to process the recaptured visas expeditiously to ensure that qualified healthcare professionals are available where and when they are needed. \nThese visas would be available to the physicians and nurses who are currently unable to finalize their green card applications due to green card backlogs. Because of these backlogs and depending on their country of birth, many physicians and nurses face decades-long wait times before they can finalize their green card applications. \n\nSHM welcomes the reintroduction of these bills as an important first step toward addressing a critical shortage in our healthcare system and recognizing the vital role immigrant physicians and nurses are playing in the fight against COVID-19. \n\nUrge your legislators to support the reintroduction of the Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act by cosponsoring and working to pass this legislation. Help ensure that our nation�s healthcare needs are adequately met during and after the COVID-19 national emergency.',

        Title: 'Please Support the Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act',
        Description:
            'While grappling with the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the nation is struggling with another converging crisis: the opioid epidemic. Throughout the duration of the public health emergency (PHE), opioid overdose deaths have reached all-time highs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioid overdose deaths increased 20% between May of 2019 and May of 2020, with 81,000 overdose deaths recorded�the highest ever on record in a twelve-month period.[1]\nIn order to effectively combat this crisis, we need to eliminate the �X-Waiver� and expand access to buprenorphine, an opioid medication that is used to treat opioid use disorder (OUD). Since buprenorphine is classified as a Schedule III controlled substance, providers are unable to prescribe buprenorphine without completing a training and applying for a special license, known as the �X-Waiver.� \n\nWhile buprenorphine is highly regulated, research demonstrates the drug is rarely abused and is used by patients to maintain their sobriety-not to get high. Buprenorphine does not need to be administered in a tightly monitored treatment center. The minimal oversight required makes it a highly effective medication to treat opioid addiction in the era of COVID-19 and telemedicine. Expanding access to this medication will also help reduce the stigma associated with addiction treatment, as patients experiencing addiction will be able to seek treatment from a provider they know and trust, rather than search for a X-Waivered provider.\n\nSHM supports the passage of H.R. 1384/S. 445, the Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act (MAT) of 2021, which would eliminate the �X-Waiver,� thus increasing access to buprenorphine.',

In order to alleviate some financial pressures, Congress issued a moratorium on Medicare sequester cuts, which are automatic across-the-board cuts to control Medicare spending.  Without Congressional action, the moratorium is set to expire and the cuts will go into effect on March 31, 2021. To ensure providers are able to provide quality care throughout the duration of the pandemic, we strongly urge Congress to pass the Medicare Sequester COVID Moratorium Act (H.R. 315). This legislation will extend the moratorium on Medicare sequester cuts until the end of the public health emergency (PHE).\n \nPlease tell Congress to support this critical legislation.',

They are the co-chairs for the general board committees and through that experience they have the opportunity to enhance project management skills like creating agendas, following through with tasks and gathering feedback.\n\nMentors\n\nOur mentors are a group of our most dedicated teens who have participated in our leadership programs throughout their high school years. The mentors have the distinct privilege of being chairs of our annual fundraising events and learn about the fundraising and development side of our community events. This is also a chance for them to mentor and guide the incoming group of teen leaders and share insights from past boards and experiences.\n\nTeen Board Liaison\n\nThis position is the connection between our organizational board of directors and our teen body. Our teen board liaison will conduct periodic collection of program assessment from teens as well as lead feedback discussions, and will act as a representative of the general teen body to FC staff and the board of directors.',

Not sure if you\'re ready (or have the time) to volunteer solo? No worries! Not all of our supporters are "volunteers."  At Shelter Group Runs you can meet some dog-loving runners and an adoptable dog without the pressure of volunteering by yourself. (And if you like the experience, you can then decide to go through Volunteer Orientation at a later date, or stick around for an orientation immediately following.)

We need workers who are willing to get a little dirty and are able to communicate in a friendly but assertive way with teams.

This volunteer position offers great flexibility and will work with your schedule. Our complete open season extends from April 1st, 2021 through November 20th, 2021 but length of time involved is flexible (i.e. you could be a spring, summer, or fall docent).\nAbout Wyck: Wyck is a National Historic Landmark house, garden, and farm in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia that served as the ancestral home to one Philadelphia family for nine generations (1690-1973). Here, traditional Quaker culture blended with a passion for innovation. The people who lived and worked at Wyck expressed these values through their commitment to education, horticulture, natural history, and preservation. wyck.org\nGuides will:\nShow the first floor of the house consisting of a front parlor, vestibule, conservatory, library, dining room, and pantry and their associated collection items.\nHighlight certain of our most prominent pieces, such as our famous Strickland folding doors, Ben Franklin Chair, Women of Wyck, and portrait of Reuben Haines III by Rembrandt Peale, but tours are flexible in that each volunteer can speak on what they find most interesting about the house/family/collections.\nSpeak about the Wyck Rose Garden and our farm, but docents are, generally, not required to walk the grounds. Most guests explore the grounds in a self-guided aspect.\nFill out a simple guest log for each group that comes to the house during open hours. This log is used for Wyck to track visitation and not used to evaluate the guide.\nIn the summer months, docents should dress comfortably and be prepared for the heat associated with an historic home.\n Scheduling:\nGuides are asked to cover at least two shifts a month during our open hours on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, but we are open to varied scheduling needs.\nThe house is open from 12-4, the docent allowing for approximately a quarter of an hour before and after the shift for opening and closing of the house. (11:45am-4:15pm)\nBeing a docent at Wyck is a chance to become part of the vibrant Historic Germantown community, and tell some unique stories.',

        Description:
            'URDC Volunteer Service Days are special days sponsored by URDC congregations and local churches where church members and others in the community spend a few hours helping low-income and elderly homeowners with indoor repairs such as painting, sheet rock, cleaning, woodwork, plumbing, and gardening. The day gives volunteers the chance to personally make a difference to improve the safety, health, and quality of the lives of those in the community needing assistance.\n\nA typical URDC volunteer day runs from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM, and volunteers can participate for as many or few hours as they like. No special skills are needed and lunch is provided. The days are generally scheduled between May and October.\n\nURDC sponsored its first volunteer day in 2013 in memory of Marion Taylor, a member of First United Methodist Church of Germantown (FUMCOG) and long-time URDC staff member, who died suddenly in 2013. As URDC�s Housing Coordinator, Marion�s hard work, persistence, and advocacy helped thousands of low-income and senior residents in Germantown and Mt. Airy. Since 2013, FUMCOG honors Marion�s commitment to the community by sponsoring an annual volunteer day in her honor.\n\nA number of URDC congregations and Philadelphia area churches have made a difference in northwest Philadelphia by sponsoring URDC volunteer days, including First Presbyterian Church in Springfield (Flourtown), Abington Presbyterian Church, Glenside United Church of Christ, and Mishkan Shalom. If you or your congregation wishes to join URDC to build a better Germantown, please fill out the form below.',

Such cuts to programs already struggling to serve every survivor who walks through their doors would mean that hundreds of thousands of people would be unable to access lifesaving services every year. \n\n \n\nThis decrease has the potential to eliminate services for victims of domestic violence in Philadelphia and across the nation.

The new reauthorization bill must invest in evidence-based prevention, enhance survivors� access to safety and justice, and maintain critical protections for vulnerable communities. \n \nCongress can improve the current law in the following ways:  \nIncrease its investment in domestic and sexual violence prevention\nClose the �boyfriend loophole�, prohibiting adjudicated dating violence and stalking perpetrators from owning or possessing firearms;    \nImprove access to housing for victims and survivors;   \nStrengthen Protection for immigrants by addressing gaps in obtaining U-visas; \nPrevent detention and deportation for immigrant survivors; \nEnd impunity for non-Native perpetrators of violence against Indigenous people and children.  \nAddress jurisdictional gaps to hold non-Native perpetrators accountable for violent acts such as: sexual assault, child abuse co-occurring with domestic violence, stalking, sex trafficking, and assaults on tribal law enforcement officers on tribal lands;   \nHelp survivors gain and maintain economic independence; and   \nMaintain existing protections for all survivors  \nVAWA has been instrumental in the progress made to support victims with the goal of ending domestic violence.

        Description:
            'State funding enables Women Against Abuse to provide services and support to on average 11,500 people each year, and yet, we are still forced to turn away thousands of requests for safe shelter annually due to lack of space and funding. Adequate funding for domestic violence allows us to better serve the complex needs of survivors in our community.  \n \nContact your Pennsylvania state legislator and urge them to support vital programs for survivors of domestic violence by maintaining funding for these items in the state budget. \n \nMaintaining state funding is necessary to ensure our continued capacity to better meet the needs of survivors. Victims of domestic violence in Pennsylvania deserve a budget that prioritizes their safety and adequately funds these lifesaving programs and services.',

However, we still need your help to pass legislation that addresses the specific needs of survivors in our communities.  \n \nOur community needs a package that invests in in the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) and the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), includes a critical fix to the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to maintain funding for victim services, addresses homelessness and affordable housing, and addresses the needs of non-citizen immigrant victims.\n \nUrge your legislator to pass a COVID-19 relief package that addresses the housing, economic, and physical and mental health needs of survivors of domestic and sexual violence and the advocates that serve them.\n \nTAKE ACTION by writing a letter to your legislator today!',

        Description:
            'In the United States, firearms have been the weapon of choice in most domestic violence related homicides. H.R. 8 is designed to better protect communities and victims of domestic violence by ensuring that firearms are kept out of the hands of known perpetrators.\n \nThe mere presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation makes it five times more likely that a woman will be killed.\n \nUnder the current law, guns sold at a gun show, over the internet, or to friends and family are allowed to be sold without verifying that the buyer isn�t legally prohibited from purchasing it due to prior domestic violence arrests or other reasons. H.R. 8 is a commonsense piece of legislation that will update our background check laws to cover all gun sales to ensure that firearms are only sold to individuals who are allowed to keep them.\n \nClosing this deadly loophole in federal background checks is the first and most important step that Congress can take to help prevent dangerous people from purchasing a gun. Now is the time to help to end preventable domestic violence deaths by firearm.',

FVPSA supports programs like Women Against Abuse by ensuring that families staying in safe havens have 24-hour security, food, and support.\n \nFVPSA funds emergency shelter, counseling, legal assistance, and preventative education to millions of adults and children.\n \nCongress has not reauthorized FVPSA since 2010, leaving it more vulnerable to significant funding cuts. Senators Heller (R-NV), Casey (D-PA), Grassley (R-IA), Coons (D-DE), and Cornyn (R-TX) have introduced S. 2784, and Representatives Thompson (R-PA), Blunt Rochester (D-DE), Stefanik (R-NY), and Moore (D-WI) have introduced H.R. 6014, House companion bill, the FVPSA Reauthorization Act.',

In addition to supporting our 24-hour hotline, our volunteers will now virtually (until WOAR is safely able return to providing this service in-person) advocate for victims/survivors who are seeking medical attention at Philadelphia Sexual Assault Response Center (PSARC) at 300 E. Hunting Park Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19124.\n\nYour help is vital to WOAR�s operations. Many survivors end up seeking our therapy services after speaking with one of our volunteers, so please consider joining our support team. Volunteers are required to participate in a 40-hour training course to become a Sexual Assault Volunteer Counselor. The training is done in a group setting consisting of presentations, videos, readings, and role-playing. You will learn about the sexual violence continuum, court proceedings, the forensic rape exam, crisis counseling skills, and agency services. After the training course is completed, you will listen in on hotline calls before doing it on your own. All sessions must be attended. Our limit for SAC trainees is 25 per cycle and are on a first-come, first-serve basis.',

        Description:
            'Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, charities across the U.S. have seen increased demand for services.  Raise your voice to ask Congress to fight for charities the next relief package.\n\nCharitable donations dropped by 6% in the first quarter of 2020 according to a report by the Fundraising Effectiveness Project.  Charities across the U.S. have seen increasing drops in giving since then. The Chronicle of Philanthropy reports 2020 giving could be down by as much as $25 billion.\n\nThe drop in donations caused by job losses and economic uncertainty comes just as demands on charities are skyrocketing.  Without the ability to raise more private donations, some charities may have to close and many will not be able to meet the rising need for help caused by the pandemic.\n\nFortunately, Congress recognized the importance of charitable giving incentives and created a universal charitable deduction for 2021. The deduction was expanded to $300 for individuals and $600 for couples. Join us in urging Congress to build on this first step and expand and make the new "above-the-line" charitable deduction permanent. This would allow people to give more and provide charities the resources to meet the pandemic head-on.\n\nAsk your Senators and Members of Congress to extend and expand the recently enacted charitable giving incentives. Join us in fighting for charities by sending an e-mail now.',

        Description:
            'The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC) are two of the best tools we have to promote work, put money in the pockets of working people and reduce child poverty. \nThe economic havoc brought about by the coronavirus pandemic will have wide-ranging and long-lasting effects, especially on low-wage workers, children and their families. Making the expanded EITC and Child Tax Credit (CTC) permanent would help millions of Americans from sliding into poverty and also help stimulate local economies. In addition, Congress is thanked for including the look back provision to permit filers to base the EITC and CTC for tax year 2020 on earnings in either 2020 or 2019, whichever provides a larger credit.\n\nOfficial estimates predict unemployment to rise to 16 percent this year and stay close to 10 percent through the end of 2021. Bold and targeted policy steps must be taken to get the economy back on track.\n\nA permanent expansion of the EITC for workers not raising children at home and young people just starting out, as well as expanding the CTC in the next legislative package would deliver a well-timed boost to the economy while also encouraging and rewarding work and help many weather the current economic crisis. \n\nE-mail Congress now to expand these common sense policies for working Americans who are currently shut out of the credit and struggling to navigate the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.',
