        Description:
            'In the past twelve years, 11th Hour Theatre Company has emerged as Philadelphia’s premier boutique musical theatre company. In 2016, 11th Hour was awarded a New Theatre Works Initiative grant by the Independence Foundation, and in 2013, 11th Hour became the first-ever recipients of the June and Steve Wolfson Award for an Evolving Theater. Our work focuses on presenting intimate, character-driven stories rather than flashy, budget-busting spectacles. Our hope is that these stories prove the relevance of musical theatre in the contemporary world, engaging audiences and inspiring the next generation of musical theatre artists for years to come.\r\n\r\nWe produce a broad spectrum of musicals that fill a niche in the diverse Philadelphia theatre landscape: musicals that spark the creativity of our artists and the imaginations of our audience. In the 2014-2015 season, we produced our first world premiere, Michael Ogborn’s Field Hockey Hot, which was a smashing success, and motivated us to create one of the first original cast albums to come out of Philadelphia in years. To date, we have produced twenty-one full-scale musicals, ten of which were Philadelphia premieres. Our hugely popular Next Step Concert Series is a staged-reading series that showcases musicals seldom seen in Philadelphia. In addition to Field Hockey Hot, the company has contributed to the development of several new musicals beginning with Angst, a ten-minute musical that premiered in the Spark Festival of 2005. We produced the American premiere of Austentatious that went on to success at the New York Musical Theatre Festival; and a 29-hour reading of Fantasy Football, the Musical? before its production at New York University. Both Austentatious and Fantasy Football have since been published and are now professionally licensed. In the fall of 2014, we partnered with University of the Arts to workshop Persephone Unplugged, a new twist on the classic Greek myth.',

        Description:
            'A Little Taste of Everything (ALTOE) is a non-profit agency whose mission is to increase access to nutritious, affordable foods and provide food system education for low-income populations in Philadelphia. ALTOE grew out of a youth-driven project at University City High School (UCHS) in conjunction with the Urban Nutrition Initiative (UNI) and received its non-profit status in 2005. ALTOE evolved from previous efforts to improve food security in West Philadelphia communities through school gardens and farmers’ markets.\r\n\r\nALTOE’s mission is put into action through the Mill Creek Farm (MCF), an educational urban farm project. The Mill Creek Farm (MCF) is located at 4901 Brown Street in the Mill Creek Neighborhood of West Philadelphia.  The Mill Creek runs under the land we work on and was enclosed in a sewer 100 years ago. Housing was built on fill that was not stable for the foundations and began to subside. It was eventually torn down in the 1970s. Since that time there has been a community garden on the western portion of the block, but the eastern portion sat vacant except for trash and weeds until 2005.  In August 2005, the Philadelphia Water Department awarded ALTOE 1.5 acres of vacant land, at 49th and Brown Streets in the Mill Creek Neighborhood of West Philadelphia, on which to start the project. Initial funding for MCF came from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection’s Growing Greener Grant for Stormwater Management and the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society (PHS). The Mill Creek Farm had a successful first season in 2006, and has continued to grow and progress as a model for local food system development and sustainability education in succeeding years.',

Visitors to the Academy have the opportunity to get face-to-face with towering dinosaurs, meet live animals, and explore a tropical garden filled with live butterflies. Philadelphia’s natural history museum offers surprises for all ages, from changing interactive science exhibits to a children’s discovery center, a fossil dig, and opportunities to interact with real science experts.\r\n\r\nThe Academy’s working scientists spend their days focusing on critical global issues in biodiversity, evolution, and environmental science. In the field, Academy scientists have traveled as far as Vietnam to sample wild bird populations for emerging diseases such as avian influenza, and closer to home they have been studying the effects of natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale. These research efforts and many others enable the Academy to provide accurate, real-time scientific information to the public on environmental and sustainability matters.\r\n\r\nThe Academy’s collections contain more than 18 million specimens and archival treasures and rate among the world’s most significant in terms of geographic, biological, and historical depth and breadth. Many specimens in the Academy’s collections predate the institution’s founding and reflect the work of famous naturalists and scientists, including Thomas Jefferson, John James Audubon, Meriwether Lewis, and William Clark. This “library of life” records the extraordinary diversity of life on Earth and preserves a long-term record of environmental change.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Academy CEO George W. Gephart, Jr., and Drexel University President John A. Fry announced the completion of a historic affiliation between the Academy and Drexel. This unique affiliation unites two of Philadelphia's most respected research institutions and promotes discovery, learning, and civic engagement in the natural and environmental sciences.",

This work led ASAP to rallying around the four citywide initiatives it has today – ASAP Chess, ASAP Debate, ASAP Drama, and ASAP Scrabble.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this shift in focus was profound. By 2007, ASAP’s four citywide initiatives were serving more than 4,000 youth. During this time, ASAP also assumed leadership of the Philadelphia Scholastic Chess League and the Philadelphia Scholastic Debate League. Both leagues flourished under ASAP’s direction, quickly rivaling the District’s athletic leagues in size',

Over the years, the possible interpretations of the phrase, any kid is capable & any kid will participate, eventually permeated all aspects of his methods as an educator and director. In January of 2004, AKWD became a 501(C)3 nonprofit born of Barrick\'s overwhelming desire as a preschool educator to finally "get this right." Today AKWD is an innovative educational model. George Barrick passed away in 2008 but his project is carried on as a labor of love by  original collaborators and some new friends as well.\r\n\r\nThe intention of AKWD is to assist young humans in appreciating their own ability in a respectful loving environment.

        Description:
            'Since establishment in 1953, Allens Lane Art Center has been a cornerstone of the Mt. Airy community by bringing the residents together to participate in and enjoy the arts.  Whether its art classes for children or adults, amazing art exhibitions, or cutting edge plays on the mainstage, there is something for everyone at Allens Lane.\r\n\r\nAllens Lane Art Center (ALAC) was founded in 1953 by an interracial group of Mt. Airy residents who were concerned about the dangers of increasing community tension. Most were parents of children attending local schools who felt that increasing access to the arts would be a way to bring people together as well as develop individual talents. "Living Together Through the Arts," a program of The Ford Foundation and the Henry Home & School Association, originally sponsored ALAC.  We formally incorporated as a nonprofit organization - 501 c(3) - on June 29, 1953.\r\n\r\nALAC\'s founders saw creative activities as an effective avenue for channeling the energy of youth in a constructive way. Developing artistic skills and appreciation for the arts would help round the education of local youth and build self-esteem in a non-competitive way. Most importantly, creative activities would bring people of diverse backgrounds together and help them overcome prejudices. Today, Allens Lane still promotes "living together in the community through arts" by offering programs and activities that enrich the lives of numerous children and adults.',

Jennifer Green, CPDT-KA is a certified dog trainer and her son Kevin Daly, USMC was deployed to Afghanistan twice with the 1st Battalion 8th Marine Regiment. Upon Kevin’s return home, they decided to combine their knowledge and experience of dog training and post deployment struggles to tackle these growing problems, and help to lower the suicide rates of US veterans by providing emotional and physical support with trained service dogs.\r\n\r\nAlpha Bravo Canine believes in helping these brave warriors, who fought for our country’s freedom, by giving back to them.\r\n\r\nProviding these veterans a trained service dog. A fully trained service dog from puppy to graduated dog can cost approximately $25,000-30,000 for up to the two year time frame.

The extreme care that every administration has taken of the funds derived from that famous 1891 Bazaar has given us a sound investment program today. It enables us to maintain an exceptional scholarship program: Numerous alumnae each year receive generous tuition support at colleges and universities. We also give Commencement prizes and tuition grants. Since 1963 we have contributed thousands of dollars as well as books to the GHS library. We donate to school funds and publications. In 1984 we began to subsidize the cost of Advanced Placement examinations taken by qualified seniors. Our support today ranges from capital projects like the installation of a dance floor and statue restoration, to student activities like the robotics team and academic competitions, to subsidies for graduation festivities. In 2001, we finished production of a video history of Girls’ High that highlighted events of our school’s sesquicentennial year in 1998.\r\n\r\nNow over 4,800 financial members strong, as the alumnae association celebrates its 125th anniversary, we take pride in our heritage, and eagerly anticipate the challenges that lie ahead.

Amachi’s hope is that one-to-one mentoring by caring adults will significantly improve the life opportunities of the children. Studies have clearly demonstrated that the Big Brother Big Sister (BBBS) mentoring model has positive effects - and now through Amachi, the strengths of mentoring and congregational volunteers are brought together.\r\n\r\n“Amachi” is a Nigerian Ibo word that means “Who knows but what God has brought us through this child.”',

            "The company operates the U.S. Navy's Center of Excellence in Electronics Manufacturing (Electronics Manufacturing Productivity Facility EMPF). The EMPF focuses on the development, application and transfer of new electronics manufacturing technology by partnering with industry, academia and government centers and laboratories in the United States in order to maximize available research capabilities at the lowest possible cost. ACI also provides training, consulting, testing, analysis, and engineering services to the electronics industry.\r\n\r\nACI was established in 1992 by its founder and current CEO, Alan J. Criswell. His vision was to develop a vehicle to bridge the gap between leading edge applied research efforts in electronics manufacturing and the successful integration of the developed technologies on the factory floor. Relying on a thorough understanding of the dynamics of the electronics industry and knowledge of the ever-increasing void in successful technology insertion, ACI successfully privatized a regional, government operated laboratory known as the EMPF in 1995. ACI transformed this facility into a National Center of Excellence offering best-in-class technical resources in electronics manufacturing to the U.S. Navy, the Department of Defense, and industry.\r\n\r\nToday, ACI's National Center of Excellence Model serves as a conduit to leverage the nation's best technical resources from government, industry, and academia in a cooperative and cost-efficient effort to maximize the development and insertion of electronics manufacturing technologies across a broad base of industrial partners. This leveraged technical capability has and will continue to contribute greatly to ensuring the competitiveness of the U.S. industrial base in electronics manufacturing.",

The museum’s founder, Dr. Amandus Johnson inspired a group of committed, successful Swedish-Americans to build the Museum as a permanent monument to Swedish contributions in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Museum is located on land that was once part of a seventeenth-century land grant from Queen Christina of Sweden to Swedish colonist, Sven Skute. The Museum’s architect, Swedish-American John Nydén, combined architectural features from three prominent edifices in his design. He modeled the main building after a seventeenth-century Swedish manor house, Eriksberg in Södermanland. The copper cupola atop the building is inspired by the one on Stockhlom’s City Hall, and the arcades which flank the Museum are patterned after those at George Washington’s home, Mount Vernon.\r\n\r\nThe Museum’s 20,000 square foot interior is currently divided into twelve exhibition galleries, reference library, curatorial storage and archives, offices, museum store, large dining room/conference area and kitchen. The Museum is available to rent for wedding receptions, corporate meetings, and parties',

In the 1987 Assessment of Ten Historic Structures in Fairmount Park considered to be at risk, Belmont Mansion was singled out as the most significant structure studied, and among the most important in Fairmount Park. This work was followed by a complete historical study and architectural analysis published as The Belmont Mansion Historical Structures Report. On this basis, the restoration of Belmont Mansion became the first major project of the Fairmount Park Historic Preservation Trust in 1994.\r\n\r\nThe AWHS is a non-profit historic preservation organization that raises funds from membership fees, admissions, rentals, grants and donations. Through the Society, Belmont Mansion has become an interpretive and educational center for American history and culture. The Society seeks to expose the community to the fine arts (literature, art, dance and music), as well as build bridges of communication and interaction among various ethnic communities in Philadelphia. Belmont Mansion also serves as a site for wedding receptions, private parties, meetings of civic and cultural organizations, and tours for visitors.",

            'ANNA Crusis Women’s Choir is the longest-running feminist women’s choir in the United States, founded in 1975 by Dr. Catherine Roma. When deciding on a name for this new choir, Cathy liked the play on words that the musical term anacrusis lent itself to. By adding another “n” and making it a woman’s name, her small start-up group had immediate personality and warmth.\r\n\r\nToday, ANNA is a widely recognized vocal ensemble in Philadelphia, with 80+ singers, committed to musical excellence and promoting social change. Led by Artistic Director Miriam Davidson, ANNA’s membership embraces diversity of age, ethnicity, and gender identity; our music repertoire reflects the rich spectrum of human lives and struggles, shedding light on issues facing immigrants and refugees, young people, women, the LGBTQ+ community, and others.\r\n\r\nANNA self-produces two major concerts each year and performs many community outreach programs throughout the season. We can often be heard singing at benefits, rallies, LGBTQ+ community events, prisons and shelters — anywhere that music can bring a sense of hope and empowerment. ANNA has performed at numerous venues in Philadelphia and New York City, such as the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, the Annenberg Center, World Café Live, the United Nations, and Carnegie Hall. We are honored to have been invited to participate in the International Festival of Choirs to be held in Santiago de Cuba this coming October/November 2019. ANNA has also sung with artists including Dr. Ysaye Barnwell (Sweet Honey In the Rock), Demi Lovato, Holly Near, Melanie DeMore, Sharon Katz and the Peace Train, and a host of others.',

We provide comprehensive and collaborative programs throughout Philadelphia in schools, social service agencies, the courts, and at community sites.',
        Description:
            'AVP was incorporated as a 501c(3) organization in 1983. The following year, Families of Murder Victims (FMV) opened in the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Homicide Unit to serve individuals who have lost a loved one to homicide. By the 1990s, AVP was gearing up to expand its reach. In 1996, AVP established the Counseling Center, which provides free therapeutic counseling to children, families and individuals who have witnessed or experienced violence in their lives.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, AVP established West/Southwest Victim Services, a program supporting and advocating for victims of violent crime in a community-based setting. In October 2007, AVP began collaborating with the Medical Examiner’s Office where AVP’s crisis intervention specialists work to meet the immediate practical and emotional needs of victims’ loved ones in the days following a homicide, including providing support at the time of identification of their loved one’s remains and assistance in receiving compensation for funeral and other related costs.\r\n\r\nThe Youth Violence Outreach (YVO) initiative was established in the fall of 2016. By identifying young people who have experienced violence-related trauma and providing them with effective counseling and therapy to help them process the experience, YVO works to interrupt the cycle of violence. The school-based work is a combination of services that provide trauma-informed care directly to youth, emphasizing outreach to adolescent males of color who have the highest rates of victimization and violent behavior and who are often difficult to reach in non-school settings.\r\n\r\nAVP programs and staff have been recognized by many local, regional, and national awards. In 1989, the organization received an award for Excellence in Victim Services from the National Organization for Victim Assistance and an award from the Philadelphia County Medical Society for Outstanding Health Services followed in 1994. Most recently, in 2004, AVP was a recipient of the GlaxoSmithKline Community Partnerships IMPACT award, given to non-profit organizations for excellence in improving the healthcare of the underserved in their communities.',

        Description:
            'Philadelphia has more than 32,000 vacant lots; it is one of the defining problems of our city, and one of its potential advantages, as well. In late 2013, the city passed legislation to create a Land Bank that will dispose of vacant city property, and oversee the disposition of abandoned private property. In the Land Bank Strategic Plan adopted in December 2014, the East Kensington neighborhood was designated a focus area for urban agriculture and open space. To this end, Arcadia Commons is in the process of acquiring sixteen blighted vacant parcels in East Kensington that are in danger of being developed exclusively for expensive housing.\r\n\r\nResearch shows that urban green spaces not only foster community, but also contribute to the health and wellness of local residents. Arcadia Commons’ designated parcels would be used for community gardening, a farmers market, and a pavilion for neighborhood gatherings, and educational workshops to teach people in the community techniques for growing herbs, flowers, and produce as well as marketable skills (soap-making, spinning yarn). The products derived from local production would be put up for sale at the farmers market or used for personal consumption. Through these methods, Arcadia Commons will serve area residents by providing affordable resources that will revitalize local business and build a healthy local economy.',

We believe this sanctuary transcends physical space, and that the idea of “home” is one we carry with us. Home is a place that is welcome to all, and shaped by the relationships which inspire us.',

        Description:
            'ArtSmart was born in 2015 by co-founders Michael Fabiano and John Viscardi after long analysis of the US education system, role models, technology and the economic state of affairs for artists living and working in the United States. \r\n\r\nAs artists, Michael and John had also experienced the challenges of making a living while pursuing their dreams in their early careers. For many young professional artists, working one, two or three side jobs is commonplace. More often than not, these jobs are in an industry unrelated to their area of expertise, exhausting and pull focus at a time when it needs to be developed most. \r\n\r\nArtSmart was born out of these central ideas: to create an organization that gives students in underserved communities an opportunity to pursue their dreams and grow as human beings, while supporting actively working artists to accomplish their own professional goals. \r\n\r\nArtSmart launched its pilot program at Newark’s East Side High School in September 2016. The first program of its kind, ArtSmart will have provided over 25,000 mentor sessions by mid year 2020 in 28 schools nationwide. Lessons are free of charge to the student, while mentors are compensated a competitive rate for their time and focus. The foundation serves communities in and around San Francisco, Newark, Jersey City, Philadelphia, New York City and Chicago.',

Asociación formed the Latin School for the Performing Arts (LSPA) for the development of artists and musicians, provided presentations and festivals for the community and became known for its specialized “Roots of Puerto Rican Music” workshops. This local success earned the organization national recognition including the national “Growing Up Taller” award (1997) for providing top level programming to at-risk youth, as well as Latin Beat magazine’s Siempre Salsa Special Recognition Award (2005) for extraordinary work in the field of Latin music education.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, founder Jesse Bermudez reached out to the Reverend Luis Cortés Jr, President of Esperanza to forge a strategic partnership. This relationship resulted in the creation of a new organization that draws upon the history and services of the former—and so AMLA (Artistas y Musicos Latino Americanos) was born in the Hunting Park neighborhood of Philadelphia.',

Workshops are student-centered and combine the building and mastery of arts skills with dialogue, inquiry, and reflection to explore “big ideas” and essential questions that are relevant in young people’s lives. Teaching artists engage youth in critical thought and often difficult dialogues through creativity and self expression by creating a community where students feel safe to be their authentic selves, share stories, take risks and grow.\r\n\r\nBy fostering creativity, enhancing communication and literacy skills, ArtWell helps individuals from diverse cultures and faith traditions to deepen their understandings of themselves and their community and to ultimately reduce violence and increase peace within our city and region.',

(with special ed. including ELL students). Many of those students are also over aged or under credited for typical High School graduation, but we go to great lengths to make sure they find a home at Cyber and progress toward success.",

            'In 1961, Dr. Antonia Pantoja and a group of Puerto Rican educators and professionals created ASPIRA (the Spanish word for "aspire"), to address the exceedingly high dropout rate and low educational attainment of Puerto Rican youth. They were convinced that the only way to free the Puerto Rican community from poverty and to promote its full development was by focusing on the education of young people and developing their leadership potential, self-esteem, and pride in their cultural heritage. The ASPIRA Association is currently the largest nonprofit organization dedicated to Hispanic education in the United States, with nine (9) national affiliates.\r\n\r\nASPIRA, Inc. of Pennsylvania was formed in 1969 and primarily serves the North Philadelphia community, which has the third-largest Puerto Rican population outside of Puerto Rico. To address the low academic attainment of youth in Philadelphia, ASPIRA began its hallmark Leadership Development program in 1969, which is still active in several schools today.\r\n\r\nFast forward to today ASPIRA, Inc. of Pennsylvania operates a variety of community programs, after school programs, summer camps, and an early childhood educational development program called Pequenos Pasos de ASPIRA. The work of ASPIRA schools as a charter management organization began when ASPIRA founded Eugenio Maria de Hostos charter school in 1998. ASPIRA has since founded two other schools and been given the privilege of managing two more by the School District of Philadelphia totaling the operation of five charter schools.',

        Description:
            'The relationship between the Alumni and the School started almost immediately after the 1st Class graduated in 1842 with the founding of our predecessor organization. By 1873, when the alumni formally reorganized, the AACHS was actively supporting the school’s activities.\r\n\r\nIt is critical for the future of the school that we, as graduates, give back to the school by: endowed gifts to support programs (including Science Fair, Robotics, Dramatics, Publications, Music, Art and Athletics); by our presence with Career Day; by support of special events such as International Day, and by promotion of Central’s activities through the media. We also participate in the student recruitment process, and help students and recent graduates with networking and interning opportunities. We administer close to $2 million of endowed scholarship and prize funds for the benefit of both underclassmen/women and seniors; the annual distribution of proceeds averages about 8%.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate demonstration of our commitment was the rebuilding of the Barnwell Library into a 21st century research facility and conference center. This landmark public-private partnership with the CHS faculty, students and the School District has changed the learning culture in the school. Teachers from all disciplines use the research lab to effectively teach students how to properly perform internet research.\r\n\r\nAACHS also provided for the construction of a new faculty lounge, and gifted laptop computers to all faculty members, allowing for more cross-pollination of ideas between members of various departments.\r\n\r\nThe Association works with the senior and junior class officers. They, as well as the president of the Student Association and the Editor-in-Chief of the Centralizer, participate in AACHS Board of Managers meetings. Our Alumni Journal and web site highlight school activities to encourage graduates to connect with the Central of today. AACHS also works with the Home and School Association and support its activities to assist parents to support their children’s life at Central.\r\n\r\nAlumni, on an individual basis, support the work of literary publications, and robotics by working with and advising students. They volunteer to chaperone events, such as Museum Day, and pay for students to attend alumni events such as our annual lunch, annual dinner meeting, and Thanksgiving Day Victory Breakfast.',

At that time, in most states, homosexuality could be used as cause for the loss of licensure to practice psychiatry.  After the now-infamous appearance by Dr. John Fryer In 1972, and the behind-the-scenes work of several members of what was then referred to as the GayPA, the APA removed homosexuality from their diagnostic manual (DSM). This allowed a more open association of lesbian and gay psychiatrists, who no longer had to fear for their jobs if they were found out to be gay.  Even today, the mission of providing support and a safe space for LGBTQ+ psychiatrists to meet continues to be important to many of our members. AGLP is the oldest association of LGBTQ+ professionals in the country.\r\n\r\nAGLP is an independent organization from APA, but works closely with APA through LGBTQ+ representation on the APA Assembly (the LGBT Caucus of the APA), APA position statements, LGBTQ+ Committees of the DSM, the creation and staffing of an AIDS Committee, Awards, such as the Dr. John Fryer, M.D., Award, and research and advocacy of particular interest to the LGBTQ+ Community through our quarterly Journal of Gay and Lesbian Mental Health. AGLP offers an online referral service to those seeking LGBTQ+-friendly counselling, support, and psychiatric treatment. \r\n\r\nIn 2015, The Association of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrists changed its name to AGLP: The Association of LGBTQ+ Psychiatrists, in order to serve a broader constituency of members and patients in the LGBTQ community.\r\n\r\nAGLP continues to work with APA and independently to support our members and advocate for our patients.',

In its first 10 years, ACCR has fought hard, unrelenting in the hope that its services on death penalty cases would be rendered unnecessary. When the Pennsylvania Supreme Court refused to accept years’ worth of research done by the legislative task force (which included our co-founder Dana Cook and board member Reggie Shuford), it renewed ACCR’s determination to continue to provide for and work alongside the lawyers who fight for their client’s lives. \r\n\r\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Miller v. Alabama in 2016 prohibiting mandatory life-without-parole sentences for crimes committed by children, ACCR became one of the first organizations to participate in facilitating this new opportunity for a second chance for the hundreds of Pennsylvania prisoners. 25 percent of the two thousand prisoners condemned to life without parole as children were from Pennsylvania.  \r\n\r\nLooking forward, we know that if the death penalty were abolished, ACCR’s work would not be done. ACCR’s mission has focused on capital punishment, but its broader concerns about injustice, racism, and fairness within our criminal legal system are still pervasive.',

        Description:
            'In 401 AD, Saint Augustine urged the Council of Carthage to call on the Emperor to reestablish the office of defender of the rights of the poor. In this tradition, A.D.R.O.P. continues to work as defenders of the most vulnerable members of society.\r\n\r\n A.D.R.O.P. was founded in 2004 by Jack Deegan, O.S.A.  Fr. Deegan brought leaders, service providers, and volunteers together to assess the needs of the poor in South Philadelphia and began to match those needs with known resources.  Since that time our 150 volunteers and leaders have affected the lives of over 1,000 families living in the South Philadelphia Area.\r\n\r\n Poverty is rampant today and the gulf between the rich and the poor is widening. We, as Augustinians and laypeople, must make poverty the center of our ministry and devote a major portion of our time, talents and resources to fostering systemic change in the way poverty is addressed.\r\n\r\n We must join with educational institutions, parish ministries, and other grassroots organizations to use their expertise to understand the causes of poverty and what can be done to effect real, sustainable change.',

It was on March 23, 1982, when a brave group of men (some still marching with us today), took a shot on a then-struggling group, and Avalon was reborn. The band has continued to have great success, finishing in the top ten all but three times since the reorganization. \r\n\r\nThroughout the years, Avalon has been fortunate enough to play all over the world, which included stops in New Orleans, Dublin, and Sicily. More notably, the band has also had the privilege to play at Governor Ed Rendell’s Inaugural Ball, as well as the Presidential Inaugural Parade for Bill Clinton – an honor that very few bands can say they hold.',

Since that time we have continued producing three shows a year, alternating between the two spaces. The Theaters at the Drake are known as Philadelphia’s Home for New Plays, and we embrace that moniker, so far producing eight world premieres there - all by Philadelphia-based playwrights.',

He displayed them alongside African masks, native American jewelry, Greek antiquities, and decorative metalwork.\r\n\r\nDr. Barnes was a strong supporter of progressive education and social justice, and he worked closely with black communities in the belief that people—like art—should not be segregated.\r\n\r\nTo better serve Dr. Barnes’s educational mission, the Foundation moved to Center City Philadelphia in 2012, where its vastly expanded program reaches 12,000 Philadelphia schoolchildren every year.

        Description:
            "The history of Beacon Theatre Productions begins in 2011 with Georgina Bard – a theatre artist in the Philadelphia area who saw the need for theatre that not only educates, inspires, and challenges, but is accessible to communities and individuals who may not have the means to experience it otherwise. With this desire, she incorporated the company in 2011, sought out board members and other professionals, and by July of 2012, Beacon Theatre Productions became an official 501(c)(3) organization.\r\n\r\nSince 2011, Beacon Theatre Productions has found a place in the Philadelphia community: producing theatre that spotlights critical moments of the past to show the way to a better more equitable  future. Shows are often free to the public or offered at affordable ticket prices. Since 2011, BTP has brought plays to a variety of venues including schools, community centers, historical sites, senior living communities, churches and other indoor and outdoor locations. We have produced plays about the enslavement of people of color, those who worked for the abolition of slavery, the mistreatment of employees prior to the establishment of labor unions, the struggle to obtain woman's suffrage, the unjust treatment of Black soldiers during the American Civil War, and a deeper compassion for those experiencing trauma and grief. We have brought to life the characters of:  O. Henry, Arthur Conan Doyle, Frederick Douglass, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, C.S. Lewis, Sigmund Freud, Harriet Forten Purvis, Charlotte Forten Grimké, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucretia and James Mott. We have also hosted other theatre artists' portrayal  of  historical characters such as Mrs. Deborah Franklin, Harriet Tubman, Richard Allen, Dorothy Day, Sojourner Truth and more.",

        Description:
            "Carpenters' Hall is a treasure in historic Philadelphia. It hosted the First Continental Congress in 1774 and was home to Franklin's Library Company, The American Philosophical Society, and the First and Second Banks of the United States.  Carpenters' Hall is the official birthplace of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a key meeting place in the early history of the United States.\r\n\r\nCompleted in 1775, the two-story brick meeting hall was built for and still privately owned by the Carpenters' Company of the City and County of Philadelphia, the country's oldest extant craft guild. The First Continental Congress met here in 1774 and it was the location of the Pennsylvania Provincial Conference in June 1776. Their proceedings officially declared the Province of Pennsylvania's independence from the British Empire and established the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, mobilized the Pennsylvania militia for the American Revolutionary War, set up the machinery for the Pennsylvania Provincial Convention which framed the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, and enabled the United States Declaration of Independence to proceed. It was briefly occupied in 1777 by the British Army during the war.\r\n\r\nThe site was designated a National Historic Landmark on April 15, 1970.",

        Description:
            'CFAR was founded in 1994 under the name, Center for Growth and Development by Maryann C. Volk.  Maryann was a former teacher and principal with the Archdioceses of Philadelphia.  During her tenure she became acutely aware of a growing vacuum between struggling children in school and families struggling to survive in the community.  She witnessed families first hand facing serious issues, ones that required greater support than she was able to provide in the context in which she served them.  Maryann in her 50’s decided to go back to school to obtain a Master’s degree in Marriage and Family Therapy.  Shortly after obtaining her degree, with the purchase of a corner row home, CFAR opened its doors to its first client with one room and one therapist. This row home was where CFAR would spend the next twenty years.\r\n\r\nAs the need for family therapy grew we set out to find our new home.  In July 2016, CFAR closed its doors to the row homes on Magee Avenue and moved into a location double its size on Bustleton Avenue. CFAR although much smaller than most agencies, made a name for ourselves through our unique family systems perspective.  Focusing on the family as a whole has been the key to our success in seeing lasting change in Philadelphia families.\r\n\r\nToday, under current Executive Director Jordan Brogan, CFAR serves an average of 350 families a week and has trained over 100 Marriage and Family Therapists.',

To solve this, Eli began baking challah with friends, and quickly realized she and her friends could use challah-baking to mobilize and educate others. They began selling the challah and donating the profits to social justice causes. Word of Eli’s project spread, and soon Eli was guiding students, from all corners of the globe, as they started their own CfH chapters.\r\n\r\nA decade after Eli’s first challah sale, CfH continues to thrive. Currently, thousands of Jewish student participants on 80+ campuses across the US, Canada, UK, and Australia gather on a regular basis to continue the centuries-old tradition of baking challah together and practicing tikkun olam in an inclusive environment. For all the volunteers and many of the customers, CfH provides opportunities to be involved in a fun and dedicated community, address humanitarian problems, develop and practice new skills, gain business and leadership experience, and engage in traditions of challah and tzedakah.',

Once the cats receive a clean bill of health, we place them in one of our dedicated foster homes. We advertise our foster cats online and at outreach venues such as the Clark Park Farmers Market.  City Kitties also collaborates with Baltimore Pet Shoppe, displaying our adoptable kitties in the store window.\r\n\r\nThose interested in adopting fill out an application, let us know which cats they are interested in and, once approved, meet the cats in their foster homes. Once an adopter falls in love with a cat, we arrange transportation, bring the foster cat to its forever home, and provide ongoing support as needed. City Kitties runs entirely on generous donations from Philadelphia residents and beyond. \r\n\r\nCity Kitties is run entirely by volunteers, from our board of directors to our foster homes.

Instead, because of our services, these same people will have their financial situation assessed by our supervising attorney and their case referred to a pro bono attorney or law student.  Our volunteers then walk the client through the many steps involved including, but not limited to, gathering all the necessary documents, completing the required forms, as well as advising the client about the debt counseling that is needed or court dates that are scheduled.\r\n\r\nUltimately, CBAP’s goal is to have our clients leave after receiving our services in better, more sustainable financial situations than when they came to us.

In January 2005, Curio joined in partnership with the Calvary Center for Culture and Community at 4740 Baltimore Avenue, Philadelphia. This partnership continues to raise capital to restore the building's once abandoned sanctuary into a professional performing arts venue. In 2012, Curio worked with Calvary to build another performance space in the underused basement of the building. This allowed Curio to expand its production season, and gave our education department more room to hold classes throughout the year.\r\n\r\nSince 2004, our programming has consisted of productions and education. On average we produce four shows a year for the public. Beyond our productions, we also run a theatre school for the local West Philadelphia students, as well as a theatre camp that runs throughout July. In 2015, the Education Department introduced a new program called Curiositeens. This is a free program for local teenagers that runs throughout the school year, and offers the students a chance to go deeper into their theatrical training.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to serve the West Philadelphia Community, and we look forward to providing our community with affordable theatrical opportunities in the years to come!",

Together, they chose as their namesake the master of the Italian Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci.  \r\n\r\nDVAA permanently moved to 704 Catharine St. in South Philadelphia in 1966. Since then, the building has housed artist studios and exhibitions annually. \r\n\r\nIn 2015, DVAA hired its first full-time Executive Director to improve the Artist Membership program. DVAA’s Artist Membership program now offers several annual exhibition opportunities for artists and critically engaged programs monthly. To build community within Philadelphia, DVAA has created a Fellowship program for underserved artists, designed an annual community art and science festival called Da Vinci Fest, and installed a permanent mural on our building.',

The Darren Daulton Foundation was born out of Darren’s love and inspiration for serving and helping others. The Foundation serves as an extension of Darren’s love for people. The way in which he lived every day.\r\n\r\nWe have all been impacted by Darren one way or another. Whether you were a baseball player, a close friend or a devoted fan, Darren treated you like family. Even with all the fanfare and publicity that surrounded Darren, at the core he was humble and put others before himself. This is why he chose to use his notoriety to bring awareness and funding to this disease.\r\n\r\nAfter a courageous battle, Darren passed away from his bout with cancer on August 6, 2017.  Although Darren is no longer with us, his spirit lives on through the Foundation, which is committed to providing financial assistance to those who suffer from malignant primary brain tumors. The Board of Directors, together with Amanda Daulton, vow to continue supporting those who are affected by this devastating disease and raising awareness for brain cancer.\r\n\r\nSince its inception the Darren Daulton Foundation has granted over $250,000.00 to more than 100 people',

The in-house therapist provides trauma-informed counseling both individually and in group sessions.\r\n\r\nDawn’s Place provides a safe, non-judgmental environment to up to eight women affected by CSE. We offer a year-long residential program. Each resident works with a social worker to develop a plan for recovery, moving through the program in phases designed to methodically and simultaneously increase responsibility for themselves, their future, and the community which enables them to build a sense of freedom and empowerment. Our holistic program includes trauma-informed therapy, peer mentor support, art and music therapy, mindfulness instruction, access to health care, education, legal assistance, life and social skills coaching, career training, finding housing, and access to a fitness area. We connect residents dealing with addiction or mental health issues with off-site intensive outpatient programs. As women progress through the program, the skills they acquire become self-sustaining, allowing them to become drug-free, sober, employed and able to live independently.',

        Description:
            "Originally incorporated as the Delaware Valley Lyric Opera Guild, DVOC was started in 1979. The intention of its founders was to offer a stepping stone for singers, providing training and education through exposure to all facets of operatic production, and performance opportunities in a variety of operas. During the first year, two operas and a concert were produced at various Center City locations while a permanent space was sought.\r\n\r\nIn 1981, the Company discovered the Hermitage Mansion, one of Philadelphia's historic Fairmount Park homes, and began to lease it from the City. A year later, an outdoor stage was built in the natural amphitheater behind the Mansion and became the Paul D. Osimo Outdoor Theatre. The Mansion served as the Company's administrative base, rehearsal space, costume and scenery storage site, and the location for its Winter Concert Series in the living room. The mansion is no longer used by DVOC. The company has performed in several venues in the Philadelphia area since leaving the mansion in 2008. Currently DVOC performs at the Venice Island Performing Arts and Recreation Center in Manayunk.",

All of this takes the form of a competition with winners receiving recognition, scholarships, and monetary prizes, as well as a chance to compete in the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair.\r\n\r\nMany of our competitors go on to some of the top colleges and universities followed by careers in STEM. Many of our past competitors have credited the work that they did for DVSF and the feedback that they received from our judges with starting them on their path. It has been proven that the "inquiry-based hands-on" approach to learning STEM is effective. In fact, "inquiry" is now a top priority in the state educational standards for Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. \r\n\r\n​',

            'It all started in 1959 when, after taking First Prize in a special mention category, a Brigade led by their now legendary Hall of Fame Captain Bill Isaacs was accepted into the Fancy Brigade Division of the Mummers Parade. The name chosen for this new Brigade was “Downtowners". The Brigade\'s first 3 years of competition failed to produce a top 10 showing. Although not achieving success in the early years, an attitude and character was forming which would be the foundation of one of the most innovative and successful Brigades on Broad Street.\r\n\r\nThe Downtowners won their first championship in 1964 with "Coronation". The Brigade repeated as champions in 1965 with "Genghis Khan and the Mongols". After a 9th place finish in 1966, the Brigade won two more back to back championships in 1967 and 1968 with "Trooping the Colors" and "Tomahawk to Peacepipe". After only nine years of existence the Downtowners had won 4 First Prizes and became, in the words of Captain Bill Isaacs, "the ones to beat".',

In 2012, a group of visionary leaders - from business, education, philanthropy and civic life - saved 4 schools in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia that were slated to close due to declining enrollment. These leaders realized that closing schools might provide short-term relief but would not address the long-term viability of the Archdiocesan high schools. In a groundbreaking decision, the Archdiocese transferred the management of 17 high schools and 4 schools of special education to Faith in the Future, a new nonprofit that is independent of the Archdiocese. This commitment to Catholic education is the driving force of FIF. \r\n\r\nBut the most important metric for Faith in the Future is student success. As Catholic schools, we embrace our mission to educate servant leaders prepared to meet today’s global challenges. SAT scores have been rising across the network, and 93% of our students continue their education at a two-year (12%) or four-year (81%) college. Our students embrace a commitment to serving others through meaningful volunteer work. Extracurricular activities and athletics develop well-rounded young adults.',

Programming initiatives support the mission and vision of the organization, continuing a close association with the Olde Fort Mifflin Historical Society.\r\n\r\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the British Army bombarded and captured the fort as part of their conquest of Philadelphia in autumn 1777. The United States Army began to rebuild the fort in 1794 and continued to garrison and build on the site through the 19th century. It housed prisoners during the American Civil War. The army decommissioned Fort Mifflin in 1962 and returned it to the City of Philadelphia. Historic preservationists have restored the fort.',

In the early days of the school, boys and girls were educated separately.  Under the direction of Mother M. Edmonda Prendergast, calisthenics and elocution were introduced to the curriculum.  Mother Prendergast was also the first principal to have a graduation ceremony for eighth grade students.\r\n\r\nAt the turn of the century Saint Malachy School served 600 students.  Most students went off to work after eighth grade but some attend high schools such as Roman Catholic High School for Boys and Catholic Girls High (now Hallahan).  The 20th century brought many changes to the school.  Most of the Irish families moved from the neighborhood and a large number of African Americans migrated from the south.  More lay faculty members taught at the school and the Sisters of Mercy ended their time at Saint Malachy School in 1992.\r\n\r\nDespite changing demographics and challenges during the past 153 years, Saint Malachy School has remained an anchor in the community and continues its tradition of providing a quality education rooted in Catholic values to the children of North Philadelphia.',

Mrs. Odongkara, who only a few years early had fled with her family to the United States due to the violent dictatorship of Idi Amin, decided to return to Uganda to help children left destitute due to war, displacement and the HIV/AIDS crisis.\r\n\r\nDespite these challenges, UNIFAT grew from that tree and became one of the best schools in the region, serving as a beacon of hope and a symbol of excellence in Northern Uganda. Today, UNIFAT School serves students from kindergarten through primary seven (the equivalent of eighth grade in the United States).

Our programming exposes audiences to genre-defying performances and installations by accomplished and emerging innovators who push the boundaries of art-making and redefine the artistic landscape worldwide.\r\n\r\nEach September, the organization presents the annual Fringe Festival, a 3-week celebration that fills the city’s neighborhoods with more than 1,000 curated and independently produced performances. Year-round, FringeArts presents an equally compelling line up of performances at its state-of-the-art venue on the Delaware River Waterfront—a renovated historic building that also houses La Peg Restaurant & Bar and Haas Biergarten.  This line up includes Blue Heaven Comedy Festival in February, High Pressure Fire Service—a series of new works by local artists—running March through June, Hand to Hand Circus Festival in the summer, and additional programming for late night and outdoor events in Haas Biergarten throughout the year.\r\n\r\nAs a catalyst for cultural and community development, and a destination that brings artists and audiences together, FringeArts is central to the city’s vibrant arts community and the enrichment of the lives of those who reside, work, and visit here.',

Our work is centered on commercial corridor revitalization and community economic development.',
        Description:
            'Vibrant commercial corridors or “Main Streets” contribute to strong neighborhoods. They provide a place to work, shop, and meet your neighbors. Germantown United CDC provides direct assistance, advice, and support services to small businesses and those looking to form microenterprises in Germantown. Staff members work to improve the Central Germantown commercial corridor. We engage directly with merchants and commercial property owners, and facilitate local access to supportive business programs. Examples include: assistance navigating city services, licenses, permits; helping businesses access capital; financial and technical assistance; grant and loan referrals; business planning; and more. Due to the current environment, assisting businesses with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, re-openings, and the application process for relief packages and other grant/financing resources has been an immediate priority. \r\n\r\nIn addition to direct services and door-to-door merchant outreach and site visits, we also monitor and encourage compliance with established regulations and report issues to relevant city agencies as needed.  We also look for opportunities to strengthen and diversify the mix of commercial uses in the business district, the potential to reuse vacant or underutilized properties, business and job attraction strategies, and seek available sources of funding to support recommended revitalization strategies.',

People in conflict come to the Mediation Program to resolve their disputes through mediation.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly 100 years of service to delinquent/dependent youth, Good Shepherd Corporation phased out its youth residential programs. In 1982, a needs assessment of the 14th and 35th police districts in Northwest Philadelphia was conducted to identify community concerns. It became apparent that crime and violence resulting from escalating, unresolved disputes - particularly involving youth - were the social problems about which community residents were most concerned. In 1984, Good Shepherd Neighborhood House was established as Philadelphia's first neighborhood justice center, serving the 14th and 35th police districts. Good Shepherd Mediation Program currently offers mediation, and training and consulting services to the Greater Philadelphia area. In 2016, the Mediation Program moved to the Museum area to be more centrally located.\r\n\r\nGood Shepherd uses a voluntary mediation process designed to resolve interpersonal and community conflicts peacefully.",

Haile’s own inspiration to enter a career in law, a chance conversation with a female attorney that planted the seed “I could do that too”, led to history being made when Haile became the first African-American female Superior Court judge in Delaware in 1992. This shows the power of exposure, example and inspiration. \r\n\r\nWe strive to provide positive experiences in academics, cultural exploration and community service.  We see the benefits of our involvement in the lives of our students continually. Since participating in our programming, we have witnessed increased reading comprehension, improved grades on report cards, and a rise in overall confidence of the students.

Using their own resources and their home as a base of operations, they created this family-centered community institution that effectively mediated gang conflicts and came to serve as a source of counsel and individual development for neighborhood gang and nongang youth. The family model “provides a sense of belonging, identity, and self-worth that was previously sought through gang membership” (National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, 1999:59). Through reparenting  and providing role models, the House of Umoja has “successfully transformed more than five hundred frightened, frustrated, and alienated young minority males into self-assured, competent, concerned, and productive citizens” (National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, 1999:16).',
