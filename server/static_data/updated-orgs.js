        Description:
            "In the past twelve years, 11th Hour Theatre Company has emerged as Philadelphia's premier boutique musical theatre company. In 2016, 11th Hour was awarded a New Theatre Works Initiative grant by the Independence Foundation, and in 2013, 11th Hour became the first-ever recipients of the June and Steve Wolfson Award for an Evolving Theater. Our work focuses on presenting intimate, character-driven stories rather than flashy, budget-busting spectacles. Our hope is that these stories prove the relevance of musical theatre in the contemporary world, engaging audiences and inspiring the next generation of musical theatre artists for years to come.\n\nWe produce a broad spectrum of musicals that fill a niche in the diverse Philadelphia theatre landscape: musicals that spark the creativity of our artists and the imaginations of our audience. In the 2014-2015 season, we produced our first world premiere, Michael Ogborn's Field Hockey Hot, which was a smashing success, and motivated us to create one of the first original cast albums to come out of Philadelphia in years. To date, we have produced twenty-one full-scale musicals, ten of which were Philadelphia premieres. Our hugely popular Next Step Concert Series is a staged-reading series that showcases musicals seldom seen in Philadelphia. In addition to Field Hockey Hot, the company has contributed to the development of several new musicals beginning with Angst, a ten-minute musical that premiered in the Spark Festival of 2005. We produced the American premiere of Austentatious that went on to success at the New York Musical Theatre Festival; and a 29-hour reading of Fantasy Football, the Musical? before its production at New York University. Both Austentatious and Fantasy Football have since been published and are now professionally licensed. In the fall of 2014, we partnered with University of the Arts to workshop Persephone Unplugged, a new twist on the classic Greek myth.",

Our constituent ensembles are made up of world-class musicians who have been praised for their stunning performances of music which many people consider to be some of the world's greatest creative achievements.",

        Description:
            "A Little Taste of Everything (ALTOE) is a non-profit agency whose mission is to increase access to nutritious, affordable foods and provide food system education for low-income populations in Philadelphia. ALTOE grew out of a youth-driven project at University City High School (UCHS) in conjunction with the Urban Nutrition Initiative (UNI) and received its non-profit status in 2005. ALTOE evolved from previous efforts to improve food security in West Philadelphia communities through school gardens and farmers' markets.\n\nALTOE's mission is put into action through the Mill Creek Farm (MCF), an educational urban farm project. The Mill Creek Farm (MCF) is located at 4901 Brown Street in the Mill Creek Neighborhood of West Philadelphia.  The Mill Creek runs under the land we work on and was enclosed in a sewer 100 years ago. Housing was built on fill that was not stable for the foundations and began to subside. It was eventually torn down in the 1970s. Since that time there has been a community garden on the western portion of the block, but the eastern portion sat vacant except for trash and weeds until 2005.  In August 2005, the Philadelphia Water Department awarded ALTOE 1.5 acres of vacant land, at 49th and Brown Streets in the Mill Creek Neighborhood of West Philadelphia, on which to start the project. Initial funding for MCF came from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Growing Greener Grant for Stormwater Management and the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society (PHS). The Mill Creek Farm had a successful first season in 2006, and has continued to grow and progress as a model for local food system development and sustainability education in succeeding years.",

The Academy includes physicians, psychologists, social workers, and other mental health professionals from around the world. To date, there are over 1000 Members of the Academy.\n\nThe Academy of Cognitive & Behavioral Therapies is a multidisciplinary certifying organization specifically for cognitive-behavioral therapy that evaluates applicants' knowledge and ability before granting certification.

Lack of rigor in certification represents a significant problem for both clinicians and consumers. Certification by the Academy of Cognitive Therapy indicates to the public, potential employers, and other clinicians that the individual is a skilled cognitive therapist.",

Visitors to the Academy have the opportunity to get face-to-face with towering dinosaurs, meet live animals, and explore a tropical garden filled with live butterflies. Philadelphia's natural history museum offers surprises for all ages, from changing interactive science exhibits to a children's discovery center, a fossil dig, and opportunities to interact with real science experts.\n\nThe Academy's working scientists spend their days focusing on critical global issues in biodiversity, evolution, and environmental science. In the field, Academy scientists have traveled as far as Vietnam to sample wild bird populations for emerging diseases such as avian influenza, and closer to home they have been studying the effects of natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale. These research efforts and many others enable the Academy to provide accurate, real-time scientific information to the public on environmental and sustainability matters.\n\nThe Academy's collections contain more than 18 million specimens and archival treasures and rate among the world's most significant in terms of geographic, biological, and historical depth and breadth. Many specimens in the Academy's collections predate the institution's founding and reflect the work of famous naturalists and scientists, including Thomas Jefferson, John James Audubon, Meriwether Lewis, and William Clark. This 'library of life' records the extraordinary diversity of life on Earth and preserves a long-term record of environmental change.\n\nIn 2011, Academy CEO George W. Gephart, Jr., and Drexel University President John A. Fry announced the completion of a historic affiliation between the Academy and Drexel. This unique affiliation unites two of Philadelphia's most respected research institutions and promotes discovery, learning, and civic engagement in the natural and environmental sciences.",

By the early 2000s however, the organization expanded its goals to include providing social, health and legal services for the African immigrant and refugee community in Philadelphia. This expansion was due in large part to the influx of African refugees fleeing war in various West African countries, including Liberia, Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast. Today, ACANA provides a variety of services that encourage education, community development and integration while still preserving cultural values.',

This work led ASAP to rallying around the four citywide initiatives it has today ' ASAP Chess, ASAP Debate, ASAP Drama, and ASAP Scrabble.\n\nThe impact of this shift in focus was profound. By 2007, ASAP's four citywide initiatives were serving more than 4,000 youth. During this time, ASAP also assumed leadership of the Philadelphia Scholastic Chess League and the Philadelphia Scholastic Debate League. Both leagues flourished under ASAP's direction, quickly rivaling the District's athletic leagues in size",

Barrick as a humorous and heartfelt addition to a hand drawn nondiscrimination policy sign he was asked to make at his first job as a preschool teacher 20 years earlier.  Over the years, the possible interpretations of the phrase, any kid is capable & any kid will participate, eventually permeated all aspects of his methods as an educator and director. In January of 2004, AKWD became a 501(C)3 nonprofit born of Barrick\'s overwhelming desire as a preschool educator to finally "get this right." Today AKWD is an innovative educational model. George Barrick passed away in 2008 but his project is carried on as a labor of love by  original collaborators and some new friends as well.\n\nThe intention of AKWD is to assist young humans in appreciating their own ability in a respectful loving environment.

"Living Together Through the Arts," a program of The Ford Foundation and the Henry Home & School Association, originally sponsored ALAC.  We formally incorporated as a nonprofit organization - 501 c(3) - on June 29, 1953.\n\nALAC\'s founders saw creative activities as an effective avenue for channeling the energy of youth in a constructive way. Developing artistic skills and appreciation for the arts would help round the education of local youth and build self-esteem in a non-competitive way. Most importantly, creative activities would bring people of diverse backgrounds together and help them overcome prejudices. Today, Allens Lane still promotes "living together in the community through arts" by offering programs and activities that enrich the lives of numerous children and adults.',

Jennifer Green, CPDT-KA is a certified dog trainer and her son Kevin Daly, USMC was deployed to Afghanistan twice with the 1st Battalion 8th Marine Regiment. Upon Kevin's return home, they decided to combine their knowledge and experience of dog training and post deployment struggles to tackle these growing problems, and help to lower the suicide rates of US veterans by providing emotional and physical support with trained service dogs.\n\nAlpha Bravo Canine believes in helping these brave warriors, who fought for our country's freedom, by giving back to them.\n\nProviding these veterans a trained service dog. A fully trained service dog from puppy to graduated dog can cost approximately $25,000-30,000 for up to the two year time frame.

The extreme care that every administration has taken of the funds derived from that famous 1891 Bazaar has given us a sound investment program today. It enables us to maintain an exceptional scholarship program: Numerous alumnae each year receive generous tuition support at colleges and universities. We also give Commencement prizes and tuition grants. Since 1963 we have contributed thousands of dollars as well as books to the GHS library. We donate to school funds and publications. In 1984 we began to subsidize the cost of Advanced Placement examinations taken by qualified seniors. Our support today ranges from capital projects like the installation of a dance floor and statue restoration, to student activities like the robotics team and academic competitions, to subsidies for graduation festivities. In 2001, we finished production of a video history of Girls' High that highlighted events of our school's sesquicentennial year in 1998.\n\nNow over 4,800 financial members strong, as the alumnae association celebrates its 125th anniversary, we take pride in our heritage, and eagerly anticipate the challenges that lie ahead. Join us, in supporting our enduring tradition of excellence!",

The Amachi mentoring program was developed to provide them with a different path - by establishing the consistent presence of loving, caring people of faith.\n\nAmachi mentors meet weekly with a child who has been carefully matched with them; they often live and worship in the same neighborhoods as the children. Amachi's hope is that one-to-one mentoring by caring adults will significantly improve the life opportunities of the children. Studies have clearly demonstrated that the Big Brother Big Sister (BBBS) mentoring model has positive effects - and now through Amachi, the strengths of mentoring and congregational volunteers are brought together.\n\n'Amachi' is a Nigerian Ibo word that means 'Who knows but what God has brought us through this child.'",

        Description:
            "The company operates the U.S. Navy's Center of Excellence in Electronics Manufacturing (Electronics Manufacturing Productivity Facility EMPF). The EMPF focuses on the development, application and transfer of new electronics manufacturing technology by partnering with industry, academia and government centers and laboratories in the United States in order to maximize available research capabilities at the lowest possible cost. ACI also provides training, consulting, testing, analysis, and engineering services to the electronics industry.\n\nACI was established in 1992 by its founder and current CEO, Alan J. Criswell. His vision was to develop a vehicle to bridge the gap between leading edge applied research efforts in electronics manufacturing and the successful integration of the developed technologies on the factory floor. Relying on a thorough understanding of the dynamics of the electronics industry and knowledge of the ever-increasing void in successful technology insertion, ACI successfully privatized a regional, government operated laboratory known as the EMPF in 1995. ACI transformed this facility into a National Center of Excellence offering best-in-class technical resources in electronics manufacturing to the U.S. Navy, the Department of Defense, and industry.\n\nToday, ACI's National Center of Excellence Model serves as a conduit to leverage the nation's best technical resources from government, industry, and academia in a cooperative and cost-efficient effort to maximize the development and insertion of electronics manufacturing technologies across a broad base of industrial partners. This leveraged technical capability has and will continue to contribute greatly to ensuring the competitiveness of the U.S. industrial base in electronics manufacturing.",

The Forum recognized that local Chapters could engage artists and communities in metropolitan areas more directly, vitally and efficiently than a distant, national entity could. Using this approach, the ACF Philadelphia engages composers and local residents with a wide range of creative, educational, and performance activities tailored to needs and circumstances specific to the city, its neighborhoods, and the artists who live and work here.

            "Founded in 1926, the American Swedish Historical Museum in South Philadelphia is the oldest Swedish museum in the United States. 1926 marked the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and Americans from all backgrounds were celebrating their heritage and their contributions to the United States of America. The museum's founder, Dr. Amandus Johnson inspired a group of committed, successful Swedish-Americans to build the Museum as a permanent monument to Swedish contributions in the United States.\n\nThe Museum is located on land that was once part of a seventeenth-century land grant from Queen Christina of Sweden to Swedish colonist, Sven Skute. The Museum's architect, Swedish-American John Nyd'n, combined architectural features from three prominent edifices in his design. He modeled the main building after a seventeenth-century Swedish manor house, Eriksberg in S'dermanland. The copper cupola atop the building is inspired by the one on Stockholm's City Hall, and the arcades which flank the Museum are patterned after those at George Washington's home, Mount Vernon.\n\nThe Museum's 20,000 square foot interior is currently divided into twelve exhibition galleries, reference library, curatorial storage and archives, offices, museum store, large dining room/conference area and kitchen. The Museum is available to rent for wedding receptions, corporate meetings, and parties",

In the 1987 Assessment of Ten Historic Structures in Fairmount Park considered to be at risk, Belmont Mansion was singled out as the most significant structure studied, and among the most important in Fairmount Park. This work was followed by a complete historical study and architectural analysis published as The Belmont Mansion Historical Structures Report. On this basis, the restoration of Belmont Mansion became the first major project of the Fairmount Park Historic Preservation Trust in 1994.\n\nThe AWHS is a non-profit historic preservation organization that raises funds from membership fees, admissions, rentals, grants and donations. Through the Society, Belmont Mansion has become an interpretive and educational center for American history and culture. The Society seeks to expose the community to the fine arts (literature, art, dance and music), as well as build bridges of communication and interaction among various ethnic communities in Philadelphia. Belmont Mansion also serves as a site for wedding receptions, private parties, meetings of civic and cultural organizations, and tours for visitors.",

When deciding on a name for this new choir, Cathy liked the play on words that the musical term anacrusis lent itself to. By adding another 'n' and making it a woman's name, her small start-up group had immediate personality and warmth.\n\nToday, ANNA is a widely recognized vocal ensemble in Philadelphia, with 80+ singers, committed to musical excellence and promoting social change. Led by Artistic Director Miriam Davidson, ANNA's membership embraces diversity of age, ethnicity, and gender identity; our music repertoire reflects the rich spectrum of human lives and struggles, shedding light on issues facing immigrants and refugees, young people, women, the LGBTQ+ community, and others.\n\nANNA self-produces two major concerts each year and performs many community outreach programs throughout the season. We can often be heard singing at benefits, rallies, LGBTQ+ community events, prisons and shelters ' anywhere that music can bring a sense of hope and empowerment. ANNA has performed at numerous venues in Philadelphia and New York City, such as the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, the Annenberg Center, World Caf' Live, the United Nations, and Carnegie Hall. We are honored to have been invited to participate in the International Festival of Choirs to be held in Santiago de Cuba this coming October/November 2019. ANNA has also sung with artists including Dr. Ysaye Barnwell (Sweet Honey In the Rock), Demi Lovato, Holly Near, Melanie DeMore, Sharon Katz and the Peace Train, and a host of others.",

        Mission:
            'The mission of the Anti-Violence Partnership of Philadelphia (AVP) is to reduce the entire cycle of violence by providing a wide range of services from support and counseling for victims and their families to rebuild their lives in the aftermath of violence. We provide comprehensive and collaborative programs throughout Philadelphia in schools, social service agencies, the courts, and at community sites.',
        Description:
            "AVP was incorporated as a 501c(3) organization in 1983. The following year, Families of Murder Victims (FMV) opened in the Philadelphia District Attorney's Homicide Unit to serve individuals who have lost a loved one to homicide. By the 1990s, AVP was gearing up to expand its reach. In 1996, AVP established the Counseling Center, which provides free therapeutic counseling to children, families and individuals who have witnessed or experienced violence in their lives.\n\nIn 2005, AVP established West/Southwest Victim Services, a program supporting and advocating for victims of violent crime in a community-based setting. In October 2007, AVP began collaborating with the Medical Examiner's Office where AVP's crisis intervention specialists work to meet the immediate practical and emotional needs of victims' loved ones in the days following a homicide, including providing support at the time of identification of their loved one's remains and assistance in receiving compensation for funeral and other related costs.\n\nThe Youth Violence Outreach (YVO) initiative was established in the fall of 2016. By identifying young people who have experienced violence-related trauma and providing them with effective counseling and therapy to help them process the experience, YVO works to interrupt the cycle of violence. The school-based work is a combination of services that provide trauma-informed care directly to youth, emphasizing outreach to adolescent males of color who have the highest rates of victimization and violent behavior and who are often difficult to reach in non-school settings.\n\nAVP programs and staff have been recognized by many local, regional, and national awards. In 1989, the organization received an award for Excellence in Victim Services from the National Organization for Victim Assistance and an award from the Philadelphia County Medical Society for Outstanding Health Services followed in 1994. Most recently, in 2004, AVP was a recipient of the GlaxoSmithKline Community Partnerships IMPACT award, given to non-profit organizations for excellence in improving the healthcare of the underserved in their communities.",

        Description:
            "Philadelphia has more than 32,000 vacant lots; it is one of the defining problems of our city, and one of its potential advantages, as well. In late 2013, the city passed legislation to create a Land Bank that will dispose of vacant city property, and oversee the disposition of abandoned private property. In the Land Bank Strategic Plan adopted in December 2014, the East Kensington neighborhood was designated a focus area for urban agriculture and open space. To this end, Arcadia Commons is in the process of acquiring sixteen blighted vacant parcels in East Kensington that are in danger of being developed exclusively for expensive housing.\n\nResearch shows that urban green spaces not only foster community, but also contribute to the health and wellness of local residents. Arcadia Commons' designated parcels would be used for community gardening, a farmers market, and a pavilion for neighborhood gatherings, and educational workshops to teach people in the community techniques for growing herbs, flowers, and produce as well as marketable skills (soap-making, spinning yarn). The products derived from local production would be put up for sale at the farmers market or used for personal consumption. Through these methods, Arcadia Commons will serve area residents by providing affordable resources that will revitalize local business and build a healthy local economy.",

For many young professional artists, working one, two or three side jobs is commonplace. More often than not, these jobs are in an industry unrelated to their area of expertise, exhausting and pull focus at a time when it needs to be developed most. \n\nArtSmart was born out of these central ideas: to create an organization that gives students in underserved communities an opportunity to pursue their dreams and grow as human beings, while supporting actively working artists to accomplish their own professional goals. \n\nArtSmart launched its pilot program at Newark's East Side High School in September 2016. The first program of its kind, ArtSmart will have provided over 25,000 mentor sessions by mid year 2020 in 28 schools nationwide. Lessons are free of charge to the student, while mentors are compensated a competitive rate for their time and focus. The foundation serves communities in and around San Francisco, Newark, Jersey City, Philadelphia, New York City and Chicago.",

        Description:
            "ArtWell has grown to partner with over 400 organizations and serve more than 37,000 youth in the Greater Philadelphia region. At least 85% of the young people we work with are residents of low-income neighborhoods in Philadelphia. In 2019, we served nearly 1,000 students in the greater Philadelphia area ages 5-18, including youth from private, public, and disciplinary schools, as well as community organizations and libraries.\n\nOur innovative approach utilizes best practices in Critical Pedagogy, Multicultural Education, Asset Based Youth Development and Social-Emotional Learning. Workshops are student-centered and combine the building and mastery of arts skills with dialogue, inquiry, and reflection to explore 'big ideas' and essential questions that are relevant in young people's lives. Teaching artists engage youth in critical thought and often difficult dialogues through creativity and self expression by creating a community where students feel safe to be their authentic selves, share stories, take risks and grow.\n\nBy fostering creativity, enhancing communication and literacy skills, ArtWell helps individuals from diverse cultures and faith traditions to deepen their understandings of themselves and their community and to ultimately reduce violence and increase peace within our city and region.",

        Description:
            "The relationship between the Alumni and the School started almost immediately after the 1st Class graduated in 1842 with the founding of our predecessor organization. By 1873, when the alumni formally reorganized, the AACHS was actively supporting the school's activities.\n\nIt is critical for the future of the school that we, as graduates, give back to the school by: endowed gifts to support programs (including Science Fair, Robotics, Dramatics, Publications, Music, Art and Athletics); by our presence with Career Day; by support of special events such as International Day, and by promotion of Central's activities through the media. We also participate in the student recruitment process, and help students and recent graduates with networking and interning opportunities. We administer close to $2 million of endowed scholarship and prize funds for the benefit of both underclassmen/women and seniors; the annual distribution of proceeds averages about 8%.\n\nThe ultimate demonstration of our commitment was the rebuilding of the Barnwell Library into a 21st century research facility and conference center. This landmark public-private partnership with the CHS faculty, students and the School District has changed the learning culture in the school. Teachers from all disciplines use the research lab to effectively teach students how to properly perform internet research.\n\nAACHS also provided for the construction of a new faculty lounge, and gifted laptop computers to all faculty members, allowing for more cross-pollination of ideas between members of various departments.\n\nThe Association works with the senior and junior class officers. They, as well as the president of the Student Association and the Editor-in-Chief of the Centralizer, participate in AACHS Board of Managers meetings. Our Alumni Journal and web site highlight school activities to encourage graduates to connect with the Central of today. AACHS also works with the Home and School Association and support its activities to assist parents to support their children's life at Central.\n\nAlumni, on an individual basis, support the work of literary publications, and robotics by working with and advising students. They volunteer to chaperone events, such as Museum Day, and pay for students to attend alumni events such as our annual lunch, annual dinner meeting, and Thanksgiving Day Victory Breakfast.",

            'AGLP, celebrating over 40 years of service to the LGBTQ Community, traces its roots to the late 1960s, when gay and lesbian members of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) met secretly at the annual meetings. At that time, in most states, homosexuality could be used as cause for the loss of licensure to practice psychiatry.  After the now-infamous appearance by Dr. John Fryer In 1972, and the behind-the-scenes work of several members of what was then referred to as the GayPA, the APA removed homosexuality from their diagnostic manual (DSM). This allowed a more open association of lesbian and gay psychiatrists, who no longer had to fear for their jobs if they were found out to be gay.  Even today, the mission of providing support and a safe space for LGBTQ+ psychiatrists to meet continues to be important to many of our members. AGLP is the oldest association of LGBTQ+ professionals in the country.\n\nAGLP is an independent organization from APA, but works closely with APA through LGBTQ+ representation on the APA Assembly (the LGBT Caucus of the APA), APA position statements, LGBTQ+ Committees of the DSM, the creation and staffing of an AIDS Committee, Awards, such as the Dr. John Fryer, M.D., Award, and research and advocacy of particular interest to the LGBTQ+ Community through our quarterly Journal of Gay and Lesbian Mental Health. AGLP offers an online referral service to those seeking LGBTQ+-friendly counselling, support, and psychiatric treatment. \n\nIn 2015, The Association of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrists changed its name to AGLP: The Association of LGBTQ+ Psychiatrists, in order to serve a broader constituency of members and patients in the LGBTQ community.\n\nAGLP continues to work with APA and independently to support our members and advocate for our patients.',

        Description:
            "Since its inception in 2010, ACCR has served as Pennsylvania's only resource for comprehensive capital punishment case services. Our original slogan was, 'Trying to put ourselves out of business since 2010', and it wasn't a joke. In its first 10 years, ACCR has fought hard, unrelenting in the hope that its services on death penalty cases would be rendered unnecessary. When the Pennsylvania Supreme Court refused to accept years' worth of research done by the legislative task force (which included our co-founder Dana Cook and board member Reggie Shuford), it renewed ACCR's determination to continue to provide for and work alongside the lawyers who fight for their client's lives. \n\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision in Miller v. Alabama in 2016 prohibiting mandatory life-without-parole sentences for crimes committed by children, ACCR became one of the first organizations to participate in facilitating this new opportunity for a second chance for the hundreds of Pennsylvania prisoners. 25 percent of the two thousand prisoners condemned to life without parole as children were from Pennsylvania.  \n\nLooking forward, we know that if the death penalty were abolished, ACCR's work would not be done. ACCR's mission has focused on capital punishment, but its broader concerns about injustice, racism, and fairness within our criminal legal system are still pervasive.",

It was on March 23, 1982, when a brave group of men (some still marching with us today), took a shot on a then-struggling group, and Avalon was reborn.

Named The Off-Broad Street Theater, Azuka produced 11 shows over the next four years, having expanded our programming to three shows a season. When a new congregation took over the building in 2015, we were forced to leave. Soon after, InterAct Theatre Company opened the brand new Theatres at The Drake that included two new performance spaces. We gladly joined the group of theaters there as Resident Partners. Since that time we have continued producing three shows a year, alternating between the two spaces. The Theaters at the Drake are known as Philadelphia's Home for New Plays, and we embrace that moniker, so far producing eight world premieres there - all by Philadelphia-based playwrights.",

The Barefoot Artist aims to train and empower local residents, organize communities, and take action for a more compassionate, just, and sustainable future.\n\nThe Barefoot Artist is a volunteer-based organization with few encumbrances of staff and overhead.

He displayed them alongside African masks, native American jewelry, Greek antiquities, and decorative metalwork.\n\nDr. Barnes was a strong supporter of progressive education and social justice, and he worked closely with black communities in the belief that people'like art'should not be segregated.\n\nTo better serve Dr. Barnes's educational mission, the Foundation moved to Center City Philadelphia in 2012, where its vastly expanded program reaches 12,000 Philadelphia schoolchildren every year.

With this desire, she incorporated the company in 2011, sought out board members and other professionals, and by July of 2012, Beacon Theatre Productions became an official 501(c)(3) organization.\n\nSince 2011, Beacon Theatre Productions has found a place in the Philadelphia community: producing theatre that spotlights critical moments of the past to show the way to a better more equitable  future. Shows are often free to the public or offered at affordable ticket prices. Since 2011, BTP has brought plays to a variety of venues including schools, community centers, historical sites, senior living communities, churches and other indoor and outdoor locations. We have produced plays about the enslavement of people of color, those who worked for the abolition of slavery, the mistreatment of employees prior to the establishment of labor unions, the struggle to obtain woman's suffrage, the unjust treatment of Black soldiers during the American Civil War, and a deeper compassion for those experiencing trauma and grief. We have brought to life the characters of:  O. Henry, Arthur Conan Doyle, Frederick Douglass, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, C.S. Lewis, Sigmund Freud, Harriet Forten Purvis, Charlotte Forten Grimk', Susan B. Anthony, and Lucretia and James Mott.

We are a community organization of over fifteen hundred families devoted to providing team sports for our children. Although the large majority of our members are from Mt. Airy and Chestnut Hill, they also reside in various nearby communities including Germantown, Roxborough, Oak Lane, Whitemarsh, Erdenheim, Lafayette Hill, Wyndmoor, Flourtown and Oreland. Men, women, parents and non-parents, of all ages and ethnic, racial and social backgrounds volunteer to coach the teams, run the leagues, and administer the club. Their time and dedication benefit an equally diverse group of thirteen hundred children who live or go to school in the Northwest Philadelphia community.',

Teachers in all grade levels and disciplines, and students of all abilities participate in DT Philly, which can be incorporated into class or run as an extracurricular activity.\n\nTeams begin their DT Philly journey learning about their relationship to the spaces, systems, and products that surround them.  Next they craft an essential question about a problem they see or experience, then they research the problem, and they brainstorm, prototype, and test potential solutions. \n\nAs students use the design framework to explore their challenges, they engage in new ways with teachers, peers, and their own learning.  Along the way there are moments of excitement and discovery as well as opportunities for growth, as students grapple with time management and team dynamics, as they seek to understand root causes and find new ways of looking at a problem, and as they confront constraints on what is desirable and what is feasible.',

            "Carpenters' Hall is a treasure in historic Philadelphia. It hosted the First Continental Congress in 1774 and was home to Franklin's Library Company, The American Philosophical Society, and the First and Second Banks of the United States.  Carpenters' Hall is the official birthplace of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a key meeting place in the early history of the United States.\n\nCompleted in 1775, the two-story brick meeting hall was built for and still privately owned by the Carpenters' Company of the City and County of Philadelphia, the country's oldest extant craft guild. The First Continental Congress met here in 1774 and it was the location of the Pennsylvania Provincial Conference in June 1776. Their proceedings officially declared the Province of Pennsylvania's independence from the British Empire and established the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, mobilized the Pennsylvania militia for the American Revolutionary War, set up the machinery for the Pennsylvania Provincial Convention which framed the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, and enabled the United States Declaration of Independence to proceed. It was briefly occupied in 1777 by the British Army during the war.\n\nThe site was designated a National Historic Landmark on April 15, 1970.",

        Description:
            "CFAR was founded in 1994 under the name, Center for Growth and Development by Maryann C. Volk.  Maryann was a former teacher and principal with the Archdioceses of Philadelphia.  During her tenure she became acutely aware of a growing vacuum between struggling children in school and families struggling to survive in the community.  She witnessed families first hand facing serious issues, ones that required greater support than she was able to provide in the context in which she served them.  Maryann in her 50's decided to go back to school to obtain a Master's degree in Marriage and Family Therapy.  Shortly after obtaining her degree, with the purchase of a corner row home, CFAR opened its doors to its first client with one room and one therapist. This row home was where CFAR would spend the next twenty years.\n\nAs the need for family therapy grew we set out to find our new home.  In July 2016, CFAR closed its doors to the row homes on Magee Avenue and moved into a location double its size on Bustleton Avenue. CFAR although much smaller than most agencies, made a name for ourselves through our unique family systems perspective.  Focusing on the family as a whole has been the key to our success in seeing lasting change in Philadelphia families.\n\nToday, under current Executive Director Jordan Brogan, CFAR serves an average of 350 families a week and has trained over 100 Marriage and Family Therapists.",

She missed baking challah with her family, and was looking for a connection to the Jewish community at her school. To solve this, Eli began baking challah with friends, and quickly realized she and her friends could use challah-baking to mobilize and educate others. They began selling the challah and donating the profits to social justice causes. Word of Eli's project spread, and soon Eli was guiding students, from all corners of the globe, as they started their own CfH chapters.\n\nA decade after Eli's first challah sale, CfH continues to thrive. Currently, thousands of Jewish student participants on 80+ campuses across the US, Canada, UK, and Australia gather on a regular basis to continue the centuries-old tradition of baking challah together and practicing tikkun olam in an inclusive environment. For all the volunteers and many of the customers, CfH provides opportunities to be involved in a fun and dedicated community, address humanitarian problems, develop and practice new skills, gain business and leadership experience, and engage in traditions of challah and tzedakah.",

Among early members were Benjamin and Deborah Franklin, Betsy Ross, John Penn (William Penn's grandson), and signers of the Constitution and of the Declaration of Independence, including Robert Morris, Benjamin Rush, and Francis Hopkinson.\n\nDating to 1744, the current building has been cited as 'our finest Early American church' and one of the finest Georgian structures in America. Its steeple (1754), financed by a lottery organized by Benjamin Franklin, is the work of Robert Smith, one of America's earliest architects. For 56 years, the steeple made Christ Church the tallest structure in North America.\n\nChrist Church is a privately managed historic site that is an official component of Independence National Historical Park.

History of science can yield deeper historical perspectives on pressing contemporary issues, and provides a platform for broader public engagement into the sciences.\n\nThe Consortium brings together educational, cultural and scientific institutions to promote public and academic understanding of the history of science, technology and medicine. The Consortium awards fellowships for researchers, produces events for academics and for the public and provides online resources for teaching, learning and research. The Consortium was established in 2007 as a regional collaboration of eleven institutions in the Philadelphia area. In 2014, the Consortium began to expand across the United States and Canada, welcoming the partners listed below.

Prior to establishing CAIR, its founders observed that 'the core challenge [in America], that of stereotyping and defamation, was having a devastating effect on our children and paralyzing adults from taking their due roles in civic affairs.' Within that understanding, they formed CAIR to challenge anti-Muslim discrimination nationwide.\n\nSince being established in 1994, CAIR has a successful track record in its defense of civil liberties and tolerance. It is frequently seen as the 'go-to' organization when bias is directed against Muslim individuals or institutions. Its status as the most frequently quoted American Muslim organization in our nation's media also suggests success in 'providing an Islamic perspective on issues of importance to the American public.'",

        Description:
            "Curio Theatre Company began as a touring and outreach company composed of professional artists and administrators in the Philadelphia region before being incorporated as a non'profit organization in October 2004. In January 2005, Curio joined in partnership with the Calvary Center for Culture and Community at 4740 Baltimore Avenue, Philadelphia. This partnership continues to raise capital to restore the building's once abandoned sanctuary into a professional performing arts venue. In 2012, Curio worked with Calvary to build another performance space in the underused basement of the building. This allowed Curio to expand its production season, and gave our education department more room to hold classes throughout the year.\n\nSince 2004, our programming has consisted of productions and education. On average we produce four shows a year for the public. Beyond our productions, we also run a theatre school for the local West Philadelphia students, as well as a theatre camp that runs throughout July. In 2015, the Education Department introduced a new program called Curiositeens. This is a free program for local teenagers that runs throughout the school year, and offers the students a chance to go deeper into their theatrical training.\n\nWe are proud to serve the West Philadelphia Community, and we look forward to providing our community with affordable theatrical opportunities in the years to come!",

DVAA was a creative refuge where members could show their works, hold meetings, engage in social activities, and offer intellectual and cultural exchanges and events. Together, they chose as their namesake the master of the Italian Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci.  \n\nDVAA permanently moved to 704 Catharine St. in South Philadelphia in 1966. Since then, the building has housed artist studios and exhibitions annually. \n\nIn 2015, DVAA hired its first full-time Executive Director to improve the Artist Membership program. DVAA's Artist Membership program now offers several annual exhibition opportunities for artists and critically engaged programs monthly. To build community within Philadelphia, DVAA has created a Fellowship program for underserved artists, designed an annual community art and science festival called Da Vinci Fest, and installed a permanent mural on our building.",

The Darren Daulton Foundation was born out of Darren's love and inspiration for serving and helping others. The Foundation serves as an extension of Darren's love for people. The way in which he lived every day.\n\nWe have all been impacted by Darren one way or another. Whether you were a baseball player, a close friend or a devoted fan, Darren treated you like family. Even with all the fanfare and publicity that surrounded Darren, at the core he was humble and put others before himself. This is why he chose to use his notoriety to bring awareness and funding to this disease.\n\nAfter a courageous battle, Darren passed away from his bout with cancer on August 6, 2017.  Although Darren is no longer with us, his spirit lives on through the Foundation, which is committed to providing financial assistance to those who suffer from malignant primary brain tumors. The Board of Directors, together with Amanda Daulton, vow to continue supporting those who are affected by this devastating disease and raising awareness for brain cancer.\n\nSince its inception the Darren Daulton Foundation has granted over $250,000.00 to more than 100 people",

Our holistic program includes trauma-informed therapy, peer mentor support, art and music therapy, mindfulness instruction, access to health care, education, legal assistance, life and social skills coaching, career training, finding housing, and access to a fitness area. We connect residents dealing with addiction or mental health issues with off-site intensive outpatient programs. As women progress through the program, the skills they acquire become self-sustaining, allowing them to become drug-free, sober, employed and able to live independently.",

            "Originally incorporated as the Delaware Valley Lyric Opera Guild, DVOC was started in 1979. The intention of its founders was to offer a stepping stone for singers, providing training and education through exposure to all facets of operatic production, and performance opportunities in a variety of operas. During the first year, two operas and a concert were produced at various Center City locations while a permanent space was sought.\n\nIn 1981, the Company discovered the Hermitage Mansion, one of Philadelphia's historic Fairmount Park homes, and began to lease it from the City. A year later, an outdoor stage was built in the natural amphitheater behind the Mansion and became the Paul D. Osimo Outdoor Theatre. The Mansion served as the Company's administrative base, rehearsal space, costume and scenery storage site, and the location for its Winter Concert Series in the living room. The mansion is no longer used by DVOC. The company has performed in several venues in the Philadelphia area since leaving the mansion in 2008. Currently DVOC performs at the Venice Island Performing Arts and Recreation Center in Manayunk.",

The primary goals are that the students will gain some insight into new directions for their research, learn new ways of thinking, and, in some cases, be connected with people who could help bring a potential product to market. All of this takes the form of a competition with winners receiving recognition, scholarships, and monetary prizes, as well as a chance to compete in the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair.\n\nMany of our competitors go on to some of the top colleges and universities followed by careers in STEM. Many of our past competitors have credited the work that they did for DVSF and the feedback that they received from our judges with starting them on their path. It has been proven that the "inquiry-based hands-on" approach to learning STEM is effective.

            'By using the healthy parent-child relationship as the role model for all relationships, the mission of Educating Communities for Parenting is to provide parenting education and youth development programs that cultivate independence and responsibility in young people and families, break the cycle of child abuse and neglect, and build stronger communities.',
        Description:
            "Educating Communities for Parenting offers a variety of programs and services to nearly 500 clients annually at over 25 sites including traditional, alternative, charter, and disciplinary schools; foster care residences, homeless shelters, recovery facilities, and childcare centers.\n\nECP was founded in 1976 by Sara Park Scattergood who recognized that providing and supporting parenting education would have a lasting impact on generations of families in the future. Throughout the years, thousands of teachers, parents, children and youth have benefited from ECP's programs. ECP reaches out to families from a wide cross-section of socio-economic backgrounds throughout the Greater Philadelphia area to teach them basic principles and values of parenting. These principles and values are not only necessary to become a good parent, they are critical to shaping a responsible society.\n\nThe foundation for all ECP programs is a researched-based curriculum originally developed in 1979 and continually updated to reflect new findings, evaluation feedback, and to meet the needs of new client populations. This curriculum has been used by organizations and workshops across the country. Because of Ms. Scattergood's visionary leadership over 30 years ago, ECP has grown to become a leader in the field of parenting education providing services for nearly 2,000 students annually.",

            "Incorporated in 1986, Fort Mifflin on the Delaware (FMOD) manages operations, preservation and programming at National Historic Landmark Fort Mifflin. The organization was born from the Preservation Committee of the Olde Fort Mifflin Historical Society in order to more effectively raise funds for necessary restoration and program management.\n\nSignificant restoration projects include the stabilization of the structure and restoration of the roof and cupola of the Commandant's House, the centerpiece of Fort Mifflin and the excavation and preservation of Casemate 11, believed to be the Fort's original Powder Magazine. Programming initiatives support the mission and vision of the organization, continuing a close association with the Olde Fort Mifflin Historical Society.\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the British Army bombarded and captured the fort as part of their conquest of Philadelphia in autumn 1777. The United States Army began to rebuild the fort in 1794 and continued to garrison and build on the site through the 19th century. It housed prisoners during the American Civil War. The army decommissioned Fort Mifflin in 1962 and returned it to the City of Philadelphia. Historic preservationists have restored the fort.",

Dog owners have access to the largest dog runs in Center City. Neighborhood Gardeners have a large community garden of individual plots. The entire Park serves as a passive natural park area with distinct small and large scale green areas. And Markward Public Recreation Center is the heart of the Park from which summer camps, after school programs, and other community classes and programs are offered to city and neighborhood residents alike.\n\nFSRP recognizes the value of public space. As our most recent Master Plan outlines, Schuylkill River Park plays a significant role in the daily lives of thousands of Philadelphia residents. Because of its central location within the city, its connectivity to the community and other parks, and its unique amenities, this Park draws a diverse set individuals and groups that visit for a multitude of reasons. The paths, benches, grounds and places within our Park have been the backdrop for many personal memories and collective experiences. Residents both close and far have profound relationships to our Park that go back several generations.",

        Description:
            "Saint Malachy School was founded in 1860 to serve the large population of Irish immigrants in North Philadelphia.  The current school building was built in 1891 at the direction of then pastor (later Archbishop) Edmond Prendergast.  The school's faculty was initially comprised of Sisters of Mercy. In the early days of the school, boys and girls were educated separately.  Under the direction of Mother M. Edmonda Prendergast, calisthenics and elocution were introduced to the curriculum.  Mother Prendergast was also the first principal to have a graduation ceremony for eighth grade students.\n\nAt the turn of the century Saint Malachy School served 600 students.  Most students went off to work after eighth grade but some attend high schools such as Roman Catholic High School for Boys and Catholic Girls High (now Hallahan).  The 20th century brought many changes to the school.  Most of the Irish families moved from the neighborhood and a large number of African Americans migrated from the south.  More lay faculty members taught at the school and the Sisters of Mercy ended their time at Saint Malachy School in 1992.\n\nDespite changing demographics and challenges during the past 153 years, Saint Malachy School has remained an anchor in the community and continues its tradition of providing a quality education rooted in Catholic values to the children of North Philadelphia.",

Friends of UNIFAT is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization committed to supporting the educational and peace building initiatives of the Upper Nile Institute for Appropriate Technology or UNIFAT. UNIFAT is a private primary school located in Gulu, Uganda in East Africa.\n\nFounded in 1985 by Mrs. Abitimo Rebecca Odongkara, UNIFAT formed under humble beginnings with just a few students who received lessons under a tree. Mrs. Odongkara, who only a few years early had fled with her family to the United States due to the violent dictatorship of Idi Amin, decided to return to Uganda to help children left destitute due to war, displacement and the HIV/AIDS crisis.\n\nDespite these challenges, UNIFAT grew from that tree and became one of the best schools in the region, serving as a beacon of hope and a symbol of excellence in Northern Uganda. Today, UNIFAT School serves students from kindergarten through primary seven (the equivalent of eighth grade in the United States). UNIFAT's uniqueness comes from its mission of 'learning through love and understanding,' and its desire to not just educate children but to instill the values of love and peace.",

During the weekend, Jackie and the other bloggers posted photos, tweets, and other updates about their experience together, and the response was overwhelming!\n\nWomen across the nation, and the globe, wanted to share in an experience like this. So, Jackie worked to start a website and organization that unites some of the best lady IBD bloggers, as a way to show the world that even pretty people get IBD. And Girls With Guts was born.\n\nOver the years, we've held annual retreats from Texas to Pennsylvania, with 5 Year celebration event in Chicago and now host one additional event a year that is fully-sponsored! These events are where our sisterhood was born, blossomed, and has continued to flourish.",

In 1982, a needs assessment of the 14th and 35th police districts in Northwest Philadelphia was conducted to identify community concerns. It became apparent that crime and violence resulting from escalating, unresolved disputes - particularly involving youth - were the social problems about which community residents were most concerned. In 1984, Good Shepherd Neighborhood House was established as Philadelphia's first neighborhood justice center, serving the 14th and 35th police districts. Good Shepherd Mediation Program currently offers mediation, and training and consulting services to the Greater Philadelphia area. In 2016, the Mediation Program moved to the Museum area to be more centrally located.\n\nGood Shepherd uses a voluntary mediation process designed to resolve interpersonal and community conflicts peacefully.",

Inspired by the 'effortless excellence' that Haile exhibited professionally and personally, her family created the HLA Foundation to ensure youth have access to positive examples, role models, and experiences that will both inspire and encourage excellence. Haile's own inspiration to enter a career in law, a chance conversation with a female attorney that planted the seed 'I could do that too', led to history being made when Haile became the first African-American female Superior Court judge in Delaware in 1992. This shows the power of exposure, example and inspiration. \n\nWe strive to provide positive experiences in academics, cultural exploration and community service.  We see the benefits of our involvement in the lives of our students continually. Since participating in our programming, we have witnessed increased reading comprehension, improved grades on report cards, and a rise in overall confidence of the students. Additionally, the behavior of students we've worked with has been drastically improved vs. the general school population as a result of having a caring community's guidance, encouragement, discipline and support.",

            "The House of Umoja began operating in Philadelphia during the 1970's as a unique grassroots program initiated by community residents David and Falaka Fattah (National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, 1999; see also Woodson, 1981, 1986, 1998). Using their own resources and their home as a base of operations, they created this family-centered community institution that effectively mediated gang conflicts and came to serve as a source of counsel and individual development for neighborhood gang and nongang youth. The family model 'provides a sense of belonging, identity, and self-worth that was previously sought through gang membership' (National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, 1999:59). Through reparenting  and providing role models, the House of Umoja has 'successfully transformed more than five hundred frightened, frustrated, and alienated young minority males into self-assured, competent, concerned, and productive citizens' (National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, 1999:16).",

            'HPCA provides quality, Christian education to at-risk children from low-income families.  We maintain a very low tuition with a good scholarship program so that Christian education can be accessible to the poor in our community.  We have tutoring for students who enter the school behind their grade level.  Our students have made great progress academically since implementing the Foundations & Frameworks material into our overall curriculum in 2006.  And since most of our students are not raised in Christian homes, we do all we can to train them up in the ways of the Lord.  Many of them have heard the gospel of Jesus Christ for the first time at HPCA and have come to know the Lord.  Some students have been influential in bringing their parents to church.  \n\nWe serve approximately 200 children, pre-kindergarten through eighth grade.  We are members of PACS (Philadelphia Association of Christian Schools) and the Street School Network.  We are accredited by the Middle States Commission on Elementary Education.',

The Home merged with several Jewish children's service organizations and the Association for Jewish Children was formed in 1941.\n\nJFS began in 1869 as United Hebrew Charities, and was established to provide food, clothing, fuel, medical attendance and other aid to those in need. By 1920, the agency had evolved from a largely volunteer organization to a professional organization with trained social workers. By 1948, when the agency became Jewish Family Service of Philadelphia, its services included counseling, homemaker services, services for older persons, a volunteer program, and Jewish family life education.\n\nSince both AJC and JFS were serving children and families, the two organizations merged to become JFCS, one comprehensive agency serving individuals, children and seniors through all phases of the life cycle.",

We accomplish our goals by creating interactive educational opportunities, fostering community initiatives and preserving the historic integrity of the house, grounds and outlier building",
        Description:
            "The Johnson House was built by John Johnson, son of a Dutch immigrant, for his son John Johnson Jr., as a wedding present in 1768. The Johnson family, Quakers, farmed the land and ran a thriving tannery business on their property. Stories that encompass the injustices of slavery and the perils of war; religious freedom, activism and human rights; political intrigue and ideological differences; and decency and compassion have unfolded within the walls of the Johnson House since its inception, and has been carefully interpreted and preserved to educate and inform today. From its beginnings as a manor house set in a bucolic agrarian community in the 1700's owned by enlightened religious devotees, to its role as a pivotal station along the Underground Railroad in the 1800's, and its current position as a historic preservation and educational institution in the 1900's to current day, the Johnson House continues to symbolize freedom and civil liberties while championing the importance of community,",

Published initially as an intra-Christian endeavor, it quickly evolved into an organ of Christian-Jewish dialogue and then further expanded to include all the world's major religions and ideologies, including atheism.\n\nThe Dialogue Institute (DI) emerged in 1978 as the outreach arm of J.E.S., working to put into practice the theory published in the Journal. Expanding on the pioneering interreligious scholarship and activism of its founder, Leonard Swidler, the DI promotes the principle that dialogue flourishes through interpersonal relationships grounded in trust, mutual respect, and a common search for understanding. The DI teaches the skills of critical thinking and deep dialogue that develop the capacity to reconcile differences, such that a healthy civic society can create a quality of life for all citizens in a community, through both political and nonpolitical processes.",

We have the ability, knowledge, authority and heart to save any animal that is being abused at the hands of a human.  We are limited by our financial ability to provide medical treatment and care for dogs that we take in until loving homes are found, and every day we are faced with new challenges. Fortunately, having the shelter affords us the space and dedication from our volunteers to accommodate the animals' needs, but this comes at a great expense.\n\nWe are committed to keeping Justice Rescues sanctuary open for the abused and neglected dogs we work so tirelessly to protect, but can only do so with your help. It is gratifying to know we have so many supporters who believe in what we do and who are in a position to help make a difference in the lives of the dogs that come through our doors.

        Description:
            "Since 1974 Northeast Philadelphia residents have welcomed in the holiday season by lining Frankford Avenue for Philadelphia's largest neighborhood parade. The parade has its usual assortment of string bands, high school marching bands, military units, local Scout troops, floats, community groups, politicians, and personalities. Parade themes vary from a colonial Christmas, to saluting our military, to bringing music to Mayfair. Each year the parade draws over 100,000 spectators.\n\nMayfair has had a neighborhood parade since 1967. The Thanksgiving Parade began in 1974. Kevin Kologinsky, past president of the Mayfair Merchants Association, which sponsored the event with the Kensington String Band Association and independent merchants said \"It has two purposes. It's for merchants to kick off the Christmas shopping season, and it's our 'thank you' to the community and our customers.\" It all started when two or three merchants wanted to put on a parade for the community. \"It took off from there,\" said Jack Fluehr, one of the original parade organizers.\n\nWhile everyone looks forward to the marching units make their way down Frankford Avenue from Rhawn St. to Knorr St. there was a time when the parade made it's way northward on the Avenue. The route was eventually turned around after marchers complained that they were marching up a hill instead of going down the hill as they do today.",

            "The organization got its start in 1980 as the Mt. Airy Village Development Corporation, an outgrowth of a collaboration of East and West Mt. Airy Neighbors who had tired of blighted and dilapidated buildings on Germantown Avenue, the community's business corridor. The organization initially focused on acquisition and rehabilitation of neglected commercial storefronts along the avenue, transforming them into income-producing properties owned and operated by local neighborhood merchants.\n\nIn the 1990s, the organization became known as Mt. Airy USA and added Housing Counseling to its list of services. In 2002, the organization cut the ribbon on its current home, a major commercial building at Germantown Avenue and Phil-Ellena Street housing the organization's offices, as well as a post office, a bank, a diner, and additional office space upstairs.\n\nIn 2019, the organization changed its name to Mt. Airy CDC to better reflect the work it does as a Community Development Corporation. We currently work to fulfill our mission through four program areas: 1) Housing Counseling, 2) Real Estate & Infrastructure, 3) Business Services, and 4) Community Programs.",

        Description:
            'The Manayunk-Roxborough Art Center (MRAC) was launched in April of 1953 as an outgrowth of the former Cultural Committee of the Manayunk Neighborhood Council. It sponsored the First Annual Manayunk Art Show in January of 1956. The founding members then decided to organize as a separate entity so in November of 1957 The Manayunk Art Alliance was formed. Their mission was to promote the development and appreciation of the arts. The group held its first Members Art Show in March of 1958. In October of that same year the first adult art class was conducted. Due to its growing services, a need for a permanent home became evident. In 1962 a suitable building was found at 419 Green Lane in Roxborough. At that time, the Art Alliance was granted their status as a non-profit, section 501(C)(3) corporation under the name of The Manayunk Art Center. In 2010, in order to more accurately represent our location and ServiceArea, the center was renamed The Manayunk-Roxborough Art Center.',

In March of 2000, the Board of Trustees was granted a four-year charter to establish a school serving students in 6th through 12th grades with an approved enrollment of 1155 students, making MBA one of Pennsylvania's largest charter schools.\n\nIn September of 2000, 150 6th and 7th grade students were enrolled in MBA and classes were held in the annex of the Lighthouse building on the corner of Howard and Somerset. In the second year the school expanded, adding 8th and 9th grades to accommodate rising and incoming students. With this expansion came the need for more space, so MBA moved to the historic Kelly's Korner building at Kensington and Cumberland Avenues.\n\nWith each successive year additional grades were added, and in 2005 MBA graduated its first class of seniors. These students continued on to a variety of post-secondary institutions, and have since graduated from Philadelphia Universities like Temple and Drexel.\n\nNow in its eighteenth year of educating students, Mariana Bracetti Academy continues to collaborate with parents, teachers, staff, and community members to foster a powerful culture of academic achievement and personal responsibility that prepares our students for success after graduation.",

Our playground is not just a playground, it is a second home to many who spend many hours there.

Besides play equipment for children to play on, it also has a sensory garden for children to use their five senses. It is a wonderful way for children with disabilities to explore. Mayfair Memorial Playground's ENERGI Exercise Equipment is designed for children and adults to bond and promote a healthy lifestyle while having fun together. Play is not just for kids. Our little playground has created many friendships over the years for children of all ages, young and old.",
        Description:
            "Mayfair Memorial Playground is located on Abraham Lincoln High School property. The old playground was torn out in 2008 without any notice and with no plans to rebuild according to the Philadelphia School District. A small, fiercely committed core of neighborhood activists rose up from the ruins of the playground and turned to the Mayfair Civic Association for guidance. In 2009, the committee 'Mayfair Memorial Playground Friends' was created to rebuild Mayfair Memorial Playground with three local moms at the helm. With no funding available to rebuild, fundraising started throughout the community, which in turned jump-started the civic association. In the summer of 2011, after years of hoping for a miracle we learned that GIANT Food on Grant Avenue was going to donate $80,000 for our play equipment. Mayfair Memorial Playground and GIANT Food worked along with KaBoom!, a nonprofit playground organization, to see our dreams come true.",

What has followed are programs addressing a wide set of issues men face, including isolation from close male friendships, sexual addictions, low self-esteem often due to a sense of 'failed' masculinity, as well as issues around aging, parenting and intimacy. \n\nWe have continued this work with recent additional emphasis on training professionals and advocacy for social change that increase men's awareness of challenges facing women as well as men in the area of sexual harassment, violence, homophobia and racism.",

            "Mendelssohn Club of Philadelphia, one of America's longest-standing musical ensembles, is singing in its 147th season under Music Director Dominick DiOrio. Since its founding in 1874, the chorus has carried on a rich tradition of presenting the great works of the choral canon while also premiering, performing, and commissioning new choral works at the highest artistic level. The chorus has performed under the batons of world famous conductors and has maintained a performing relationship with the Philadelphia Orchestra since the orchestra's inception.\n\nIn its more recent history, Mendelssohn Club has deepened its mission to take artistic risks that challenge both singers and audiences through commissioning new works that include cross-genre performance. Recent commissions such as David Lang's battle hymns, Julia Wolfe's Anthracite Fields, and Byron Au Yong's TURBINE integrated artistic elements such as dance, ensemble choreography, projections, and even audience movement into our performances to create a fully immersive experience for our audience members. Maestro Rardin closed his tenure with the Philadelphia premiere of Tan Dun's remarkable visual and sonic landscape, Water Passion after St. Matthew.",

And while recovery'in all its different forms and paths'is possible for all, there's a greater chance for recovery in the context of an informed, caring community with family, friends and peers involved. \n\nBased on this conviction, we've spearheaded changes over six decades that have helped transform mental health services locally, statewide and across the country'all to be more responsive to the priorities set by those served. \n\nMHP was the first in the Pennsylvania to provide peer-to-peer mental health services from neighborhood drop-in centers, which have evolved into our recovery learning centers, based on what used to be considered a radical idea: that people in recovery could help others with mental health conditions in their respective paths toward recovery by example and through mutual support. \n\nSince establishing ourselves as a nonprofit in 1951 as the Mental Health Association of Southeastern Pennsylvania, we now provide more than 40 direct services not just in Philadelphia and the four surrounding counties, and the State of Delaware. We also provide training and technical assistance across the Commonwealth and conduct advocacy work at the state and national levels.",

        Mission:
            "As one author put it, 'According to Pope Francis's theology, full time Christians don't sit down to admire their faith in the reflection of a mirror, nor talk about it over dinner, but they come out of themselves, embrace their cross with courage and walk the streets to share with the poor and needy the good news of God's love.'\n\nInspired by these words which bring the Gospel to life, we at Mother of Mercy House strive to share the mercy of God with all through prayer and sacraments, through counseling and support, through neighborhood walks, through food assistance, and by being a simple, safe, secure and steadfast Christian presence in Kensington.",
        Description:
            "Inspired by Pope Francis' call to 'be a poor Church for the poor,' to be a 'field hospital,' to 'take the Church to the frontiers,' to 'move beyond our comfort zones' and be where others might not want to be, the ministry began five years ago.  Mother of Mercy House had a simple desire to be the presence of Christ and the Church, to discern the needs of the people who live there and to respond as best they could.  Lead by Fr Liam Murphy, the entire team at the Mother of Mercy House work each day to meet God's people where they are in their lives, with the love and mercy of God.\n\nMother of Mercy House grew out of a desire to discover new ways of being Church in areas which can no longer afford big buildings and massive properties but which still need the presence of Christ.\n\nThe area of Kensington was hit hard by church closings and so it seemed obvious that this was an area to consider. Even more, being the second food hungriest district in the United States, an area filled with immigrants, a neighborhood suffering with poverty, violence and addiction, Kensington was the perfect place to bring such a new ministry.",

Rich in first and early published editions of music, as well as in contemporaneous manuscript copies, the collection includes works of the leading composers of the day, among them Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, Rossini, Verdi, and Donizetti.

We invite District teachers to integrate our approach in their classrooms, provided they commit to our program of extensive training, ongoing coaching, and individual technical assistance. Since founding the Teacher Network, we have served 12,000 students grades 3'8; at our current rate of service, over the next three years alone we will serve another 12,000.\n\nWhile we have made these important changes to our service delivery model, we have been consistent in providing a high-quality experience focused on building students' academic, social, and emotional skills through service-learning.",

The divine mandate clearly charged that this church was to be a prototype ' an original, which would receive its blueprint or direction from God as He led them in a new way on a journey of faith.  As God outlined His purpose for a new church that would touch the entire city, the Grannums' realized more than ever that they would have to step out in faith to see God's will fulfilled.

Research has found that when news stories discuss potential answers to problems, readers leave feeling more knowledgeable and empowered to solve them. Readers are statistically more likely to act, to donate to support an organization, and to evolve their opinion. Where solutions journalism is healthy, America has more informed and engaged communities.\n\nNext City publishes hundreds of stories on solutions to urban issues every year. We also compile our best reporting into eBooks, host webinars with practitioners who share lessons from their work, and convene live events such as our annual Vanguard Conference for rising urban leaders.

During this crisis, Nia introduced two programs: a preschool educational program for children ages two through six years and an after school program was introduced to provide tutorial programs for public elementary and junior high school students.

NERFA is governed by a volunteer board of directors that has been engaged in ongoing efforts to make it more of a year-round organization in order to best meet the needs and serve the interests of FAI members from the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC to the provinces of eastern Canada. \n\nThe NERFA conference features several jam-packed days and nights of music showcases, song swaps and jam sessions; informative workshops and panel discussions (most pertaining to the business of performing or presenting folk music); one-on-one mentoring and peer group sessions; an exhibit hall; open mics; communal meals, and lots of informal conversation and networking. \n\nBooking gigs may be the primary objective of some performers who attend the conference, and many concert & festival presenters and folk DJs come to scout out new artists and those whom they have not previously heard and seen in live performance. However, the conference experience is much more than that. As a music business conference, it is designed to help attendees forge connections and build community, while also providing learning and performance opportunities that can help enhance their professional and personal lives.",

The number of victims served, as well as the type of services provided, has grown over the last 30 years.

Services provided include crisis/ supportive counseling, accompaniment, financial assistance, and information/referral. In addition to providing services to crime victims, NVS provides community programs to increase safety and knowledge of NVS's services.  NVS works closely with local / citywide community groups and agencies including the District Attorney's Office, police, and government agencies such as the Social Security Administration and plays an active role in the Philadelphia Coalition for Victim Advocacy and several state and local community task forces.?

Following these documents assures Old St. Joseph's continuity with the parish's traditional commitment to lively and inspiring worship, to forming community in the model of the disciples and the early Church, to the promotion of the Spiritual exercises of St. Ignatius, and to the care of the poor, the hungry, the sick, and other disadvantaged persons. However, these documents also have moved Old St. Joseph's into new areas, including:\n\nfostering the full, active, and conscious participation of the Assembly in its liturgical celebrations;\nmeaningful sharing by Jesuits with lay parishioners the responsibility for parish leadership, including properly forming lay\nparishioners in the mission of the Society of Jesus in the United States and in the Jesuits' way of proceeding; engaging the secular culture of Philadelphia in new and expanded ways;\nestablishing regular dialogue with persons of other faith traditions; and becoming a center for lively cultural and intellectual life in Philadelphia.",

We inspire our students to become global thinkers and conscious leaders as they actively persevere towards excellence.',
        Description:
            "It wasn't long ago that the building at 100 West Duncannon Avenue contained two schools: Olney East & Olney West'both of which were included on the Persistently Dangerous Schools list by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. With their combined numbers, the two schools listed over 100 incidents involving police per year, over 60 arrests per year, and an annual 90+ students either expelled or assigned to an alternative educational youth disciplinary placement.\n \nIt was clear that the first thing Olney needed was to establish a calm environment conducive to learning. This effort began in September of 2011 when, under the School District of Philadelphia's Renaissance Schools Initiative, Olney East and Olney West were merged into one single entity: Olney Charter High School. The management and transformation of OCHS was undertaken by ASPIRA.\n\nThe initial focus for ASPIRA was to take steps to make the school immediately safe and establish a long-term culture of learning for our students. As is indicated by the PA Dept. of Ed. metrics on the sidebar, this was done with resounding success. The dramatically improved climate and the consistency of teaching staff has positively impacted the student enrollment and academic outcomes of Olney. The school also implemented a Parent Task Force, Parent Empowerment Center, and Student Excellence Center within the school.\n\nOlney Charter High School now serves more than 2,000 students in grades 9-12. Since 2011, Olney Charter has received significant local recognition and has out-ranked 14 other comparative high schools according to the School Performance Profile Score. Measures of academic progress continually emerge due to the combined efforts of staff, students and the families that invest in Olney's future",

These are Pennsylvania's fastest growing communities, but are significantly under-represented in local and state elected office.\n\nPennsylvania Voice serves as the table at which partner organizations can meet to discuss, plan, and coordinate their work. The partnership allows each individual organization to better align its vision and commitment with larger statewide and movement-wide goals.\n\nThe full participation by communities of color cannot be achieved through one election cycle, one legislative fight, or one campaign. Together, partners build the power engagement needed to break down barriers to civic participation, restore confidence in government, and bring historically marginalized populations'and their issues'to the center of public discourse.",

We engage in a wide variety of initiatives to accomplish these goals and are constantly developing new programming based on community feedback.',
        Description:
            "PMC's founders were motivated to create a new organization by a 1988 report from the Pennsylvania Judicial Reform Commission.\n\nGovernor Robert Casey (above) commissioned this blue-ribbon panel of civic leaders, public officials, legal professionals, and members of the judiciary. PMC Honorary Board Member, and then a Judge on Pennsylvania's Superior Court, Judge Phyllis W. Beck (above), chaired the committee.\n\nThe panel discovered that confidence in the judiciary was appallingly low, in large part due to the system of electing judges and the fundraising that goes along with it.\n\nThis, combined with several scandals in the late 1980s involving Pennsylvania judges, led our founders to determine that a non-profit, non-partisan organization was needed to fill the vacuum of judicial oversight and be a herald for judicial ethics.\n\nSince, PMC has vigorously advocated for a number of judicial reforms - the merit selection of appellate judges the most noteworthy among them. PMC continues to push for the selection of competent jurists based on merit, rather than through partisan political elections, an effort supported by Pennsylvania's five most recent governors.\n\nIn addition to this ongoing work, PMC also serves as an advocate, community educator, and proponent for equal access to justice.",

As a result, first line chemotherapy is the most common form of treatment for pediatric brain tumors.",
        Description:
            "Our family started The Perricelli Hope Foundation in 2016 after our daughter, Julia's, successful outcome battling a brain tumor in 2015.  We have learned an enormous amount about pediatric brain tumors and their treatment over the past couple of years.  What has really stuck with us is the fact that there is a lack of funding for pediatric cancers and that brain tumors are being treated with toxic chemotherapy medications that were developed in the 1950's.  The prognosis for the majority of children diagnosed with brain tumors is very grave and over 30% of children diagnosed with a brain tumor will die.\nOnce we were through the initial shock and crisis of a brain tumor diagnosis for one of our children, our thoughts turned to how fortunate we are given Julia's positive outcome and long-term prognosis.  We now feel a strong desire to help others who are not as lucky as Julia.  By asking our physicians where we can get involved, we learned about the Children's Brain Tumor Consortium (CBTTC).  The CBTTC is composed of fifteen of the world's leading children's hospitals working collaboratively to find better, more effective and less toxic treatments for brain tumors.  The CBTTC has collected more than 13,000 samples from close to 2,000 patient subjects, making the CBTTC the largest open-access pediatric brain tumor biorepository in the world.  The CBTTC also collects associated clinical data to facilitate the genomic analysis of bio specimens. Cell lines are developed and transplantable tumor models are then created from biopsy specimens. These models allow researchers to share their findings with other CBTTC member institutions and with the world-wide scientific community.",

The initial focus of our work was Career Academies, a model of career connected learning that our founders created. Since its inception, the Career Academy Model has contributed to higher graduation rates locally and has been transformational  nationally, where it has been replicated in over 8,000 schools.\n\nThis model groups select students and teachers within schools in small learning communities, each of which is focused on a specific career pathway(s) and supported by an advisory board of employers, representatives from higher education, and the community. Recognizing this 'pocket academy' approach privileged certain students over others, in 2008 PAI moved toward implementation of an All Academy approach, whereby all students in a school are scheduled within and benefit from participating in a Career Academy pathway.\n\nToday, PAI still provides technical assistance in implementing the All Academy Model. However, we have recently broadened our vision and body of work to include transformative Career Connected Learning (CCL) support in the following Core Services:\n\n'Work-Based Learning (WBL)\n\n'Career Pathway Development\n\n'Pre-Apprenticeship Bridge Programs\n\n'Freshman Success\n\n'Data Services",

Someone with the funds to afford bail will remain free over this same period of time. Before sentencing, both individuals are legally presumed innocent until proven guilty. The difference is that one has been locked up before trial because he/she is too poor to afford bail while the other has remained free.\n\nThe Philadelphia Bail Fund is a revolving fund that posts bail for people who are indigent and cannot afford bail.

The ensemble's repertoire includes US premieres of important but little-known works by Martin, Penderecki, and LeBaron. To celebrate the 30th anniversary season in 2007, the Chamber Ensemble commissioned a piece by the Iran-born composer and professor at the Julliard School of Music, Behzad Ranjbaran. This composition, 'Isfahan,' was given its world premiere by the Chamber Ensemble at the March, 2007 concerts.\n\nWhen the Athenaeum was closed for structural repairs, the concert location was changed to the Old Pine Street Church. This beautiful Greek Revival setting, in the heart of Society Hill, has excellent acoustics and is handicap accessible. The Philadelphia Chamber Ensemble family continues to welcome the audience with a reception attended by the musicians following each concert.

Using a multidisciplinary approach, we collaborate with our partners in child protection, law enforcement, and medical and mental health services to provide forensic interviews, victim support and counseling services at the Philadelphia Safety Collaborative, a co-located child-friendly facility. PCA is committed to using best practices and we promotes this model locally and nationally.",
        Description:
            "The Philadelphia Children's Alliance brings together a team of professionals to allow abused children to tell their story using a coordinated process in a safe and welcoming facility.  Victims of child sexual abuse have already been through so much, and the pain and shame that accompany this abuse can be overwhelming. Years ago, abused children would have to recount their trauma over and over again' to police officers, district attorneys, social workers, and more. That is no longer the case in Philadelphia, thanks to the Philadelphia Children's Alliance.\n\nDuring the last year, PCA responded to 3,274 reports of child sexual abuse with compassion and expertise. As part of these responses, PCA conducted 1,957 forensic interviews; supplied various support services to 2,141 caregivers; provided on-site counseling therapy to 188 children; referred 1,076 children for counseling off-site; and performed 602 medical exams.\n\nThese kinds of numbers make it clear that we are meeting an incredible need here in Philadelphia. But PCA brings something more to the table. While we are the only Child Advocacy Center in Philly, our leadership goes beyond city limits: we are a national best standards model for peer agencies throughout the northeastern United States, helping them develop their own children's advocacy centers (to learn more visit www.nrcac.org).",

        Description:
            "In 1993, many local law firms and corporate legal departments signed a 'statement of goals' presented by then Philadelphia Bar Association Chancellor Andre Dennis and agreed to increase minority attorney representation and retention at their organizations. Although the Philadelphia Bar Association and individual employers had made some progress since signing the statement of goals in 1993, it was recognized that a concerted effort was required if the number of minority lawyers in the Philadelphia legal community was going to increase. In 1998, Nolan Atkinson ,Jr. of Duane Morris and Jonathan Waller of Sunoco were brought together by then Philadelphia Bar Association Chancellor Edward Chacker to take a hard look at this area of concern for the Philadelphia bar.\n\nInitially, the plan was to establish a non-profit corporation which would create a registry of diverse lawyers and law students seeking positions in Philadelphia and a second registry of volunteer mentors for diverse lawyers. In addition, the new corporation would serve as a resource center for educational programs and strategies for increasing diversity as well as to promote Philadelphia as a great place for diverse lawyers to work.\n\nThe work moved forward and in 2001, PDLG was incorporated with twelve members. From this modest beginning, PDLG has grown to 35 members - 23 law firms and 12 law departments.",

While we have seen many advancements in the fight for LGBTQ rights over those years, there is still much work to be done.\n\nSince 2014, we have also sung and shared our stories with the next generation ' performing at more than 50 local high schools and colleges, reaching more than 14,000 students with our message of tolerance and acceptance. We have also given away over 2,200 free tickets to students to attend our regular performances and experience our music and community first-hand.

Hurwitz, Vice-President of the Federation of Jewish Agencies: Board of Trustees of Federation to establish a Philadelphia Jewish Archives Center as a Federation project with the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Jewish Committee as the implementing arm and allocating $10,000 a year for five years as an initial operating budget.

Initiatives to date include scholarships for the children of fallen and critically injured officers, vital life-saving new equipment for the SWAT Team and Highway Patrol, anti-bias training for police leaders citywide and for police cadets, KN95 protective face masks and critical technology software that will save lives and help solve crimes.\n\nWhile the Foundation is proud of its efforts and impact to date, its work is far from complete, especially in this era of reduced government funding at the federal, state and local levels. Moreover, the Philadelphia Police Department has seen an increased demand for its services throughout the city at a time when modern-day police work requires the acquisition of ever-more sophisticated and expensive equipment and technology, allowing the Department to better fulfill its mission of ensuring the safety and security of Philadelphia's residents, workers and visitors.",

Until that time, there had never been a pipe and drum band in Philadelphia for either department. Master of the Pipes, Dr. Edward 'Chip' Reardon, an expert and award winning pipe player and instructor, agreed to teach us the intricate and beautiful movements of the instrument, as well as develop a Drum Corps to accompany the Pipes. He conducts weekly practices at the police academy, working on rudimentary skills and providing musical direction for the band. Chip's keen ear and remarkable ability has catapulted us into the Millennium as a Pipe and Drum Band to be recognized far and wide.",

        Description:
            "The first official Pride Parade was organized in an impromptu fashion at the end of the 1980s and was intended to coincide with rally planned by the Lesbian and Gay Task Force at Love Park. It was so successful that community members met and started an organization (Lesbian & Gay Pride of the Delaware Valley, Inc.) whose goal was to produce a parade and festival at Penn's Landing each year to continue the community outreach and visibility that was achieved with that one rally. That organization evolved into what we know today as Philly Pride Presents. And that first rally grew into the largest celebration of LGBT pride in the region, now attracting over 25,000 people each year.\n\nOUTFEST is the largest National Coming Out Day (NCOD) event in the world. The idea for a NCOD grew from the second march on Washington for gay and lesbian equality on October 11, 1987. The idea quickly took hold in the LGBT community, spawning celebrations in numerous cities around the country. Philadelphia and Philly Pride was one of the first cities to organize around NCOD on a large scale by creating a block party to showcase the many facets of our community in 1990. Our event quickly grew into what the greater Philadelphia region now uniquely celebrates as 'OutFest.' Held the Sunday prior to Columbus Day every October, OutFest attracts nearly 40,000 people.",

A member of the North Philadelphia community since 1989, she had come to realize that the youth in her area lacked the opportunities for productive extracurricular activities and creative outlets. Kim had a solution. An accomplished mosaic and metal artist, she decided she would found and direct a nonprofit community arts center, where both children and adults could learn to tap into their innate creative energies. \n\nKim, along with friends and community volunteers, worked tirelessly to renovate and transform a 6,000 square foot warehouse located at 2531 E. Lehigh Avenue, into 4 beautiful visual arts classrooms and art gallery. The Portside Arts Center proudly opened their doors in January 2008 and since that time, the Arts Center has reached proportions that Creighton had not even foreseen. Currently the Center provides a 42-week after-school arts program, evening adult classes, a youth summer arts camp, and an annual community arts festival.',

At the time, the possession of syringes was illegal in the City of Philadelphia. In 1992, after lobbying efforts by the members of PPP, Mayor Ed Rendell issued an Executive Order (4-92), legalizing the possession of syringes in Philadelphia, overriding the laws of Pennsylvania, which are still in existence today. Since 1992, the breadth of services we provide or community has expanded to include: case management, medical care, overdose prevention education, and naloxone distribution. In addition, we offer housing, meals, mail services for the homeless, Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) and legal services.

Their dream was to start a foreign exchange program led with empathy and wisdom attained only through first-handed participation in the exchange experience as parents. \n\nGovernments around the world have supported the concept of international youth exchange since its inception shortly after WWII. Designed to begin healing the wounds of the war by the interchange of Japanese, German, and American teenagers, the concept was such a success that it spread worldwide. Since cultural exchanges are an official part of U.S. foreign policy, sponsoring agencies are directly regulated by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (BECA), Department of State, to insure the integrity of the programs with strict minimum standards of operating procedures and reporting. The J Exchange Program will assist in obtaining admittance into the United States.',

People with disabilities tend to lack employment, transportation, social opportunities, adequate income and education as much as two to three times more often than people without disabilities, according to the National Organization on Disabilities Survey on Americans with Disabilities 2004.\n\nBut despite these cited limitations, people with intellectual disability have great capabilities in many areas, and PEP strives to encourage and strengthen these capabilities.

During that time, RFA produced seminal research that shaped urban education initiatives locally and nationally. See our publications page for more.\n\nRFA has continued to build on that strong tradition. In 2009, RFA came under the direction of its first executive director, Dr. Kathleen Shaw. During her tenure, RFA has achieved four-fold growth; hired and cultivated high-level quantitative research capacity to complement RFA's existing qualitative expertise; competed successfully for large, multi-year projects with major national organizations and foundations; developed the Pennsylvania Clearinghouse for Education Research (PACER), an initiative designed to respond to emerging education debates and discussions with nonpartisan, rigorous research and analysis; and, in partnership with the School District of Philadelphia, the city's charter sector, and its three major research universities, launched the Philadelphia Education Research Consortium (PERC).",

        Description:
            "t all began with an idea at the Baltimore Avenue Redevelopment Corporation.  Dr. Benjamin Smallwood and Rev. Joseph D. Patterson observed the SW Philadelphia area and realized that our children needed an alternative for quality education.  They pulled a team together, now known as the Founders (refer to p.1-2) and the concept of the Richard Allen Preparatory Charter School (RAPCS) was formed.  Realizing that children are most at risk during their formative years it was decided that RAPCS would be a middle school.  This group initially met to develop the school's mission and design the school.\n\nAfter receiving its charter, RAPCS opened in September 2001 with 180 students at 2251 N. 54th Street.  This was only temporary housing and plans were in development for the building of a permanent site. Due to significant growth in its student population (approx. 370 students in year four) RAPCS outgrew the trailers.   RAPCS then moved from the trailers to a building at 5151 Warren Street.  All the while our students continued to thrive and made AYP (Annual Yearly Progress) during the 2003-2004 & 2004-2005 academic school years.\n\nDuring this time the administration and board of RAPCS diligently worked at finding a new permanent home.   During the 2004/2005 school year several options were identified and in 2005/2006 the decision was made to acquire and renovate the former Angelica laundry Plant at 2601 S. 58th Street.",

Our 'Top Docs' are repeatedly ranked by Castle Connolly for providing superior and affordable orthopaedic care to patients, both locally and nationally.\n\nHowever, it's not the size of our staff, the number of offices, or even our surgical volumes of which we are most proud. Instead, we base our success on two things: are we improving our patients' lives and are they satisfied with our service and care. Achieving these goals requires an unwavering commitment to quality.\n\nAs the healthcare industry continues its move from a volume-based system to one based on value, Rothman Orthopaedics has established and maintained a leadership position. For years, we have collected, studied and published our outcomes. We invest millions of dollars per year into our research enterprise, and we continuously ask our patients how we are performing and whether they are satisfied with the care they receive.",

Indeed, many of our alums become permanent supporters.\n\nSavoy has long been known for its large chorus and backstage crew, and has performed on professional stages, employing professional orchestras, for 115 years and counting. The Company's volunteer cast has included Hollywood film star Nelson Eddy, Metropolitan Opera soprano Margaret Harshaw, Wagnerian bass-baritone James Pease and Broadway star Wilbur Evans.",

At first, we tried a lot of different things - hand outs of free government food (butter and cheese), the start of a literacy center, distribution of food and blankets to the homeless, our own version of meals on wheels, and whatever individual help we could offer. But we soon learned that our best efforts amounted to nothing more than enabling people to stay where they were. Very little changed. Finally the vision settled on our own employees. The majority are ex-offenders, parolees, recovering addicts, and even occasional street people and the homeless. The second group, by far the smaller and sometimes not at all, were people from the middle east who came here needing jobs and a place to learn English.

What mattered then is what has always mattered at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children; that children be given access to the best possible care.  That they be meticulously tended, strengthened, and, whenever medically possible, returned to their families whole.\n\nBy 1998, the seeds were planted for another kind of extraordinary care with the creation of St. Christopher's Foundation for Children. Committed to supporting programs that address the health and well-being of children in the community served by St. Christopher's Hospital for Children, SCFC has taken especially significant strides in recent years. Through programs such as the Community Oral Health Initiatives and Farm to Families, SCFC has catalyzed impact in critically important children's health issues.",

She told me that I had to make a difference in a community that was failing our youth; a community plagued with gun violence, poverty, and low literacy rates.  We eventually had the idea of turning our family-owned bar into a learning center for local kids and teens.  Unfortunately my mother did not live to see the vision realized, but others would. In 2008, The Strawberry Mansion Learning Center was born.\n\nKevin Upshur started the nonprofit in 2008 when he transformed the corner building he inherited from his mother'formerly a bar for 40 years'into a neighborhood education and resource center. What was once a neighborhood bar'now serves up support, mentorship and a different kind of spirit. The corner brick building, peeling with manila paint, is an after school safe-haven for kids who might otherwise go home to an empty house or neglectful parents'which, inevitably, often leads to street mischief and juvenile crime. The center is much more than a place to do homework: it is a harbor light for young minds adrift in a community lackluster in motivation and positivity. In other words, 'some hope,' says Upshur, 'a roadmap to wherever you want to go.'",

Its innovative curriculum fuses classical traditions of the Renaissance era masters, luminous color of the Impressionists and a fresh, contemporary sensibility. Its goal is to produce highly skilled artists who call upon their training and abilities to create art with depth of purpose. Its artists, faculty and alumni have been featured at numerous prominent venues including exhibitions at the National Arts Club, NYC; S.R. Brennen Galleries, Santa Fe, and Philadelphia's Comcast Center.\n\nEven the school's name is filled with symbolism. In Italian, 'Incamminati' means 'moving forward' and invokes the spirit of its namesake studio founded by the Renaissance artist, Annibale Carracci. Studio Incamminati, one of the few schools of its type accredited by the National Associations of Schools of Art and Design, fulfills its vision in a number of ways. In addition to its core Advanced Fine Art Program, the school offers workshops open to the general public both in Philadelphia and with the In Your Town programs nationwide.

The original $50,000 raised was used to establish the Scholarship Endowment Foundation as a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) organization. To increase the fund, a five-year campaign was initiated in 1997 with the goal of raising $250,000 towards endowment funding.\n\nIn March 2004, the name of Scholarship Endowment Foundation was changed to the 'Legacy of Love Foundation, Inc.,' reflecting the expansion of the nonprofit organization's mission beyond scholarship awards to include supporting community-based programs",

Together, hundreds of Guild women pressed for equal wages, improved working conditions, and political representation, while receiving vocational and life skills training and support from the Guild. Their direct services and strategic communications made them some of the most notable and effective advocates in the country, ultimately advancing transformational policy change through collective voice and playing a critical role in the suffrage movement.\n\nAs the 20th century progressed, the organization became less active in policy and advocacy. The Guild established a separate trust, the New Century Trust, and continued under this name, operating largely as a social club for women. The organization was reincorporated in 2006 as a private foundation in 2016, the Board made the strategic decision to give up the organization's longtime home on Locust Street to prioritize its philanthropic work, with a new focus on gender justice. Twenty twenty marked the culmination of this shift as the New Century Trust rebranded as the Gender Justice Fund 2020, adopting a new mission and focus.",

Artblog was recognized for excellence twice by Art in America (2005, 2007) and has received grants from the Knight Foundation and elsewhere. In 2010 Artblog incorporated and became a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. We now provide a variety of services. Working as a team of writers and support staff, Artblog today is an educational laboratory and online archive generating ideas to connect the public with art. Through Artblog's work with students and emerging writers, we are mentoring the next generation of arts entrepreneurs and cultural journalists. Through work with established writers we are raising the bar on art criticism and steering the discussion into important topics for today.",

Three Aksha seeks to preserve and promote Indian culture and heritage through classical Indian Bharatanatyam dance choreography in the Philadelphia area and in other ethnically diverse regions of the world. Three Aksha has performed in major cities across the US, the UK, Europe and India.\n\nThree Aksha has been recognized for its development of new choreography within the realm of classical Indian tradition, and for its work in the Kalakshetra style of Bharatanatyam, which is renowned for its focus on the body. The company's dancers have trained in Kalakshetra Bharatanatyam under Viji for a minimum of six years, and have also studied under teachers in India.\n\nIn addition to its active performance and touring schedule, Three Aksha shares its expertise in Indian dance in workshops and lecture-demonstrations throughout the Delaware Valley. As a complement to the socially conscious themes that frequently play into the company's performance work, Three Aksha engages with social issues by working with youth and with fundraising programs.\n\nMany of Three Aksha's students have pursued Bharatanatyam to its fullest, completing arangetrams (debut performances) and receiving support for apprenticeships from the Philadelphia and New Jersey Councils on the Arts.",

Art includes graphic design and other computer-based classes. Our gallery regularly features exhibits of some of the most exciting local artists and craftspeople. A thriving after-school program and summer camp have made us the go-to spot for children's programming for many families. These changes are reflected in organizational growth. Between 2009 and 2014, the annual budget grew from $240,000 to $370,000. The after-school program expanded to 225 students per week from 10 a decade ago. Recent years have also seen a growth in outreach to local schools and organizations, and an investment of nearly $100,000 in facility upgrades. The facility now includes three art studios, two dance studios, a sophisticated computer lab, a communal room used for classes and meetings, a dedicated gallery space and a complete two-room pottery studio located on the premises. As a result, today, some 5,000 students each year, from tots to older adults, experience the arts through our programs. Our strong relationships with community partners enable us to bring arts to schools and non-profits more widely than ever before. Almost no neighborhood fair takes place without an Arts League presence. We reach an additional 7,000 people through outreach and community events.

Inspired by our differences and a shared passion for 'creation', we came together with a vision to transform a two-acre plot of vacant land into a farm. We spent our first year organizing door-to-door to strengthen relationships with our closest neighbors and local allies. We spent our second year clearing away debris and planting our first seeds of change. Our third year saw the transformation of this land into Life Do Grow: our urban farm, sanctuary, and our home.\n\nThe Urban Creators are deeply committed to our core values of: Honoring Culture & Legacy, Imagining New Futures, Racial & Economic Justice, Balance & Emergence, Interconnection &\nRelationships, The Earth, Freedom of Expression, Holistic Wellness, and Collaborative Leadership.  During our first 10 years, we practiced these values through our combination of educational programming, artistic/cultural events, and the transformation of vacant land into urban gardens and green spaces. Now, as we enter our second decade, we will continue to work towards these values through the development of our Creator Cooperative which will support the emergence of local businesses, organizations, artists, and organizers whose values align with ours and whose work will have a meaningful and lasting impact on our neighborhood. In this way, we can invest in a new generation of 'Creators' as they manifest their own dreams of urban creation, while contributing to the overall health, safety, equity, and resilience of our community.",

            'The West Philadelphia Cooperative School was founded by a small group of parents who wanted a certain kind of educational experience for their children--one rooted in play-based learning, the outdoors, and cooperation at every level. More than 15 years later, our school remains a play-based, parent-run, cooperative school. Parents work together with teachers to provide individualized attention to each child from all backgrounds and walks of life. We believe every family deserves quality, affordable childcare, and we aim to create a supportive community that is representative of and responsive to the diversity of West Philadelphia. Our goal is to give children a chance to play and learn through experimentation, express their thoughts and feelings, and feel heard in ways that are meaningful to them.',

Kee and her tenacious board of directors acquired funding from the federal Housing and Urban Development department (HUD) to purchase and renovate a once abandoned St. Bonaventure Church convent into a thriving residential facility where homeless women could find safety and support to assist in rebuilding their lives. \n\nIn addition to this funding, Women of Excellence also became a grantee of the HUD Continuum of Care program of Philadelphia's Office of Homeless Services for its Project Restoration which operated for over 10 years.  This funding assisted Women of Excellence in providing women transitioning from homelessness into clean, safe, living quarters which included a dining hall, nutritious meals, an elevator for disabled clients along with a comfortable lounge area, and a host of supportive services. \n\nAlthough she announced her retirement in 2017, Rev. Mildred Kee will continue her public service and involvement in the work of Women of Excellence, as well as other communities in transition throughout the city of Philadelphia.",

The building and grounds, together with the core of the collection, are the gifts of Charles Knox Smith (1845'1916), who purchased the estate in 1898 with the intent of transforming it into a showcase for his great collection of art. Smith opened Woodmere's doors to the public in 1910.\n\nWoodmere continues to honor Smith's vision to bring art and nature together and in recent years has acquired important examples of outdoor sculpture by Harry Bertoia, Dina Wind, and Robinson Fredenthal. Woodmere's collection consists of more than 8,000 works of art, and nine galleries offer exhibitions and programs that serve adults and children. In the George D. Widener Studio, a converted carriage house, Woodmere offers painting and watercolor classes, and the Helen Millard Children's Gallery showcases exhibitions of art made by students. To provide deeper engagement for visitors, Woodmere also offers lectures, panel discussions, gallery talks, tours, jazz and classical music series, films, and education outreach to Philadelphia schools.\n\nWoodmere is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums, a distinction held by only approximately three percent of museums nationwide. On the National Register of Historic Places, Woodmere is designated a significant structure that contributes to the historic character of the Chestnut Hill Historic District.",

        Mission:
            "Friars brings together top leaders of the Penn community who might not have otherwise crossed paths to further the true spirit of its founder, Daniel S. Keller Jr. '01 of fraternity and helpfulness. It is a diverse group of scholars, artists, athletes, and other campus members who have contributed to the Penn community and embodies the words of the Friar Creed. The group meets, plans, and attends a variety of social and community gatherings which vary from year to year but always result in an active and bonding Friars Senior Society experience. In recent years, Friar classes have raised thousands of dollars for organizations like The Homeward Initiative, I'm Free, The Philadelphia Education Fund, Habitat for Humanity the MS Society, ALS, and Relay for Life.",
        Description:
            "The Friars Senior Society of the University of Pennsylvania was founded in 1899 by members of the class of 1901 at Penn, making it the oldest organization of its kind. The fifteen charter members of the original group of Friars, inspired by the leadership of Daniel S. Keller, Jr. '01, founded the organization 'to protest cliques and strive against caddishness and snobbery, and to firmly establish uncompromising democracy in all class, college and university activities.'\n\nOriginally an all-male organization, women were admitted in the spring of 1971. While classes were limited to 20 members in the early decades, each new class of undergraduate Friars now numbers between 30 and 36. Those proposed for membership are leaders and outstanding members of their class in such roles as class officers, team captains, presidents and leaders of dramatic groups, fraternity and sorority presidents, community and university service group officers, editors of student publications, government leaders and the like. Throughout the years, Friars as an organization has been responsible for many aspects of Penn life such as the addition of straw hats to Hey Day in 1949 and the creation of Spring Fling in 1975. Friars are also responsible for Penn's school mascot, the creation of Feb Club for seniors, the Biological Basis of Behavior major and the creation of over 70 organizations at Penn.",

Active during all seasons, you can enjoy walking the trails, sledding, or, as Gerald Stern wrote, just laying 'for hours with my eyes closed listening to the great sounds.'\n\nCarpenter's Woods is preserved and maintained as an ecologically important natural area and public resource by the Friends of Carpenter's Woods. Through their voluntary efforts, the Friends provide ongoing maintenance, educational programming, and public information about Carpenter's Woods.",

            "The Catharine Park Project is a 930 square foot garden at the corner of 22nd and Catharine Streets.  Renovating this park had made adjacent properties more attractive to investment and catalyzed economic development, a core mission of the South of South Neighborhood Association. With hundreds of similar lots around Philadelphia, this project provided a template for neighborhood-based non-profits to create passive open spaces in their own communities.  As Public Property Commissioner Joan Schlotterbeck stated in a letter of support for an application to a grant from the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, 'In our inventory of public property, we have many lots just like 2200 Catharine Street. We believe that the successful implementation of the plan at 2200 Catharine Street will inspire similar transformations at these lots around the city.'",

Gorgas Park has been transformed in to the park you see today. Residents are able to enjoy a clean, safe park with their children, friends, and neighbors.\n\nGorgas Park is named for the Gorgas Family who settled in the area toward the end of the 17th Century. In 1759 Joseph Gorgas bought a half interest in land on the banks of the Wissahickon from his brother John, on which he built mills and a stone house replacing a log cabin monastery then on the site. In 1853, The Fairmount Park Commission bought the property, tore down the mills which were built and run by the family, but retained the homestead and the barn, which existed on the property.",

After months of planning the first kickball tournament, Philly Kicking Cancer (PKC) was held on August 8, 2009 at Franklin D. Roosevelt Park in South Philadelphia.  More than 200 people participated and over $10,000 was raised.  In 2009 all the proceeds were donated to the American Cancer Society in Philadelphia. After the success of the first PKC event, the planning committee quickly got to work on the 2010 tournament.  Events in 2010 rose over $30,000 for cancer research and all proceeds were donated to the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. \n\nFast forward to 2019, now operating in our 11th year the Kicking Cancer Foundation works to carry on the spirit created by Jen and continue to donate as much as possible to our partners and thus continuing our mission to KICK CANCER! We have expanded the original scope of the foundation to include other events (a cornhole fundraiser was started in 2018) and other fundraising ventures so that we can contribute as much as possible to cancer research. The Kicking Cancer Foundation has to date raised over $300,000 for cancer research.',

We focus on the need for educational/cultural opportunities for children living in disadvantaged communities and dysfunctional homes, who may be at risk of getting caught in an urban delinquent life, and offer them programming that is difficult for them to obtain because of their financial situations.  The Project has several levels of programming designed to keep the students involved as they mature and to keep them engaged with their community.  Once we have begun a relationship with the students we will monitor their participation and look for other opportunities to serve their needs by learning about the obstacles that stand in their way of receiving the most positive experiences available to them.',

We realized that some of the cats were not going into the traps because they were getting food from another source. I walked around the block and found many more feral cats being fed by another woman. While we were talking about getting her cats TNRed, I met Gracie. \n\nGracie eagerly ran up to me, meowing, sneezing, and looking for love. She was sick and needed help fast. I took her to the vet and wound up charging everything I had on my credit card to get her better. She had multiple infections and a held tilt due to some neurological condition. Despite her conditions, she never stopped being the sweetest cat in the world. Gracie was with me for exactly two months when she passed away. I was with her in her last moments and owe the start of Meraki to her. She will be remembered forever.',

Within three short years, the youth group more than tripled in size, and yet maintained a family like atmosphere filled with love and encouragement, while edifying and building each other. We focused on helping students think outside themselves, showing them God's love and how the Word of God is relevant to their world.\n\nThese students live in an evil, dangerous world, and each day they face battles and temptations unlike any generation before them. The Word of God tells us these battles are not against flesh and blood but against the powers of darkness; they are against the evil spiritual forces of the heavenly realms. So we created a place where these young people can come weekly into this environment that not only encourages them, it also teaches them how to encourage others and how to get strengthened by receiving the inspiration needed to face another week. This is how HQ was born.",

That question was posed to many other Harold Barnes mentees. The group included men, women, coaches, teachers, pastors, retired city and state employees. They shared the commonality of being raised in North Philadelphia. They shared the commonality of wanting a better North Philadelphia. They shared the commonality of a vision for change in North Philadelphia. Most of all they all shared a love for North Philadelphia.\n\nOur mantra 'I Am Because We Are' speaks to our organization's philosophy. We believe that individual greatness exist in the lives of people residing in North Philadelphia. When we collectively use that greatness to elevate the quality of life for North Philly, our city realizes it's true worth. North Philly Project is catalyst of change and restoration of dreams.

        Description:
            "Path to Greatness was thought of December 2012 after Lavon Howard (a Playworks employee serving Robert Morris Elementary school) noticed the middle school students at Robert Morris needed positive motivation and encouragement from outside people. Lavon's burning desire positively impact these students' lives led to partnering with various Philadelphia residents to participate in this life altering event. On a rainy and cold Friday, January 11, 2013, Lavon received an overwhelming response to people in support of speakers to come and speak to the students of Robert Morris. Therefore, Path to Greatness was born.  Path to Greatness became more than a one-day initiative. It became a part of the school's culture with monthly seminars on different topics that teachers do not talk about and topics that affect students' academics. Path to Greatness became a platform for students to start striving for GREATNESS and NOT mediocrity. \n\n?As fate would have it, on December 20th, 2013, Path to Greatness commenced as a non-profit organization, and as a result, serves and impacts middle school youth to be GREAT.  On Saturday February 21st, 2015, Path to Greatness became a 501c3 nonprofit organization.  \n\n?Path to Greatness has serviced over 30 K-12th grade schools, and 4 non-profit organizations. We have spoken to more than 5,000 students. Lavon has personally recruited over 500 people to speak at a PTG event.",

We are thrilled to exist. \n\nNow that we're here, we don't take anything for granted. We believe that if you do things the right way, good things will happen.

Over the years the chorus has done just that, performing a mixture of classical and current music that has attracted new members and new audiences.

At Dojos, young people between 7 and 17 learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. Dojos are set up, run by and led by volunteer members of the community, for their local community.\n\nCollege provides a pathway to high-paying jobs but only 1 in 3 adults achieve a bachelor's degree (2015 US Census) leaving many youths unprepared to enter a highly skilled workforce that they can't afford to become qualified for. A report from Burning Glass, a job market analytics firm, found that there were as many as 7 million job openings in 2015 in occupations that required coding skills. They also found that programming jobs overall are growing 12% faster than the market average. Technology skills and computational thinking are critical to promoting prosperity in the lives of youth especially those who come from low-income families.\n\nPhilly CoderDojo youth (ninjas) are developing coding expertise. Simultaneously they are being invited to attend science and technical fairs; engineering, design and robotics competitions; given opportunities for entrepreneurship by innovating and developing new technologies and exploring original design and ideas; engage in STEM internships and summer jobs; re-invest in their communities via design problem solving projects; visit and apply to technical-oriented high schools, college and universities giving them a cognitive and early professional advantage.",

            'The Philly Pumptrack was founded in 2014 as a family-friendly local park that encourages camaraderie, skill development, and of course, fun! There are two tracks, an oval beginner track, and the larger track with multiple line choices.\n\nThe Philly Pumptrack is situated on land owned by the city of Philadelphia and managed by the Friends of Philly Pumptrack at Parkside Evans in partnership with Philadelphia Parks and Recreation. The park is free and we maintain a donated fleet of high-end SE BMX bikes and Bern helmets that are freely available to visitors. Simply show up, sign a waiver, grab a bike and a helmet or bring your own and jump on the track.\n\nMore importantly, become a member of our Dig to Ride community. The Philly Pumptrack exists solely through monetary donations by individuals and social impact organizations and a dedicated group of volunteers who maintain the tracks. The Philadelphia Parks and Recreation Department provides two part-time, summer staff who provide ongoing supervision from noon to 6pm on days when the track is open from early May through the end of October.',

        Description:
            'Sankofa Healing Studio recognizes incarceration as a traumatic experience. The system of mass incarceration operates through structures of gendered and racial discrimination which disproportionately affect the Black Community. Sankofa is breaking the physical and emotional chains of trauma. We believe that holistic treatment approaches are needed to disrupt the development of re-traumatization, interrupt the cycle of inter-generational trauma, and heal the wounds of trauma that was experienced before incarceration. Mass incarceration, a form of structural racism, exposes Black Women to distinct stressors that ultimately undermine their health, the health of their children, and rips at the fabric of the Black Family unit. \n\nSankofa Healing Studio recognizes, names, and promotes healing from the impact of systemic racism on the Black Community. Racial trauma is pervasive and insidious. Studies have shown that racial trauma in the Black community is directly connected to shorter lifespans, higher rates of poverty, limited access to quality education, health disparities, increased maternal mortality, and an overall decreased sense of hope. This traumatic stress is often magnified by the lack of space to name, express, and heal from it. Sankofa Healing Studio recognizes the healing power of deep community. Our Healing Circles are grounded in principles of wellness for the Black Community and are designed to address the immediate emotional and somatic needs caused by the negative impact of race-related stress, racial fatigue, alienation, and isolation.',

            "SEPA WOC is best known for its witnesses and for Equal wRites, its quarterly newsletter. The first demonstration occurred in 1979, with the pope's visit to Philadelphia. It was small but three days later Sr. Theresa Kane made the point. In 1980 and 1981there were prayer services on Ordination Day, and in 1986 we resumed that witness. In 1987, we shifted to Holy Thursday and in 1991 we began holding two witnesses a year. Holy Thursday this year had street theater, a prayer service, women at the doors of the Chrism Mass, banners and signs; there were over 100 people there. Ordination Day has been a Eucharistic liturgy in the park across the street from the Cathedral; last year, we had empty chairs for those women not being ordained. We have held other witnesses as well: when St. Theresa was made Doctor of the Church and at large Archdiocesan events, like the gathering of Cardinals April 26, 2002. We have many contacts in the local news media, and generally are covered well.\n\nEqual wRites began in June1992 as a 'Catholic Feminist Newsletter for Women and Men in the Philadelphia Area.' It enabled us to reach a larger audience with more in-depth information about women's ordination and to publicize events of interest to progressive Catholics in the region. It has published consistently every quarter since then, with articles on women's ordination, analyses of local and national Catholic issues, book reviews, scripture reflections, personal experiences and poems, letters, a calendar of events, and a sometimes ironic column, 'Did You Know?' As contributors moved from the Philadelphia area, it has become more national in authorship.",

            'Welcome to The Plastic Club. We are a 100% volunteer-run non-profit 501c3 organization that has supported and nourished artists since 1897. We offer a selection of online activities and events, and look forward to resuming our schedule of numerous weekly drawing workshops, monthly all-media exhibitions, and lively programming of film, dance, music, and poetry. We welcome all artists, crafts people and interested parties.\n\nThe Plastic Club was founded in 1897 by a group of professional women artists at a time when already existing art clubs in the city were only open to men, the founders of the Plastic Club wanted a place for artists who were women to meet, exchange ideas, and exhibit their work. They wanted to bring experienced professionals together with younger artists who were just beginning their careers.\n\nToday, in a building purchased through member fundraising in 1909, the original mission of the now co-ed Plastic Club continues with 200+ members, ten open drawing sessions a week, and a year-round program of film, dance, music, poetry, salons, discussion groups, community dinners, and other fun events.',

West Passyunk includes two commercial corridors that have undergone significant changes within the past hundred years. From thriving avenues, to mostly vacant, and then up-and-coming, our goal is to ensure that our commercial corridors are maintained and are representative of our many cultures and needs of the diverse population that lives here. This includes maintaining commercial zoning on primary corners, increasing density where possible, driving affordable and accessible development, and increasing and encouraging alternate modes of transport along both corridors.\n\nWest Passyunk Neighbors Association is open to all individuals, regardless of ethnicity or race, gender, orientation, political conviction, religious perspective, or socioeconomic status.',

Where decisions about what to produce, and how to produce and distribute it, are made democratically. We want to build a world where everyone has a right to food, healthcare, a good home, an enriching education, and a union job that pays well. We think this kind of world is necessary for people to live rich and creative lives ' and to be truly free. The world we live in violates any reasonable standard of justice and decency. A tiny number of rich and powerful families lives off of the profits they make from trashing the environment and underpaying, overworking, and cheating the vast majority of society ' the working class. They get richer precisely because the rest of us get poorer.\n\nFor decades, we've been told what we can't have: A decent living, a home of your own, a comfy retirement ' in short, a meager share in our society's immense collective wealth. We believe it is time to take back up these promises. But moral outrage is not enough to change the world. Democratic socialists also have a strategy to break the power of capitalists and the bosses who do their bidding: we see a united, militant working class as the leading force for radical social change.",

Since 2011, Scioli Turco has partnered with neighbors, community groups and business improvement districts to identify nearby properties that are vacant and blighted.  These properties include houses, business and industrial properties, each which may be in poor and dangerous condition, attract crime, be an attractive nuisance to children and lower property values.\n\nOnce such a property is identified and meets certain conditions, Scioli Turco files an action in court whereby it seeks to be appointed conservator over the property. This means that Scioli Turco is granted permission by the court to rehab the property both inside and outside and then put it up for sale, with most of the proceeds going back to the property owner. In some instances, the property owner is given the opportunity to make improvements to the property he or she has neglected. No individual or community group has to pay Scioli Turco any fees.\n\nThe improvement of a bad property can make a great difference on a block and Scioli Turco has had much success in making Philadelphia's neighborhoods look better!

An innovative easement program preserves open space and historic facades in partnership with the Friends of the Wissahickon. Advocacy for preservation of historic buildings is initiated by the CH Conservancy and supported by our Resource Center, which directly advises homeowners on their care of their property, from maintenance to restoration to adaptive reuse.\nChestnut Hill, located in the northwestern corner of Philadelphia, is one of the region's most beautiful and architecturally distinguished communities. Flanked by the spectacular Wissahickon Gorge and Cresheim Valley, Chestnut Hill is home to outstanding examples of architecture from three centuries, many united by the use of the native stone, Wissahickon schist. Chestnut Hill began as a rural farming and milling community in the early 1700s and became the site of one of the first planned suburban communities in the 19th century. Two active railroad lines built in the 19th century still serve the bustling commercial corridor of Germantown Avenue today.",

            "The Holmesburg Civic Association is an all volunteer organization dedicated to the quality of life in our community. Holmesburg is located on Pennypack Creek, ten miles up the Delaware River from Center City Philadelphia, about one mile inland from the Delaware. It is among the oldest neighborhoods in Northeast Philadelphia with a history dating back to the late 17th century when a prominent grist mill, its attendant dam and mill race, and the King's Highway Bridge ' the oldest bridge in continuous use on a major highway in the Americas ' were collectively built on Pennypack Creek, circa 1697. The shallow fall line of the ancient creek here on the edge of the continental shelf had long been identified as a crossing point by the Lenape (Delaware) Indians on their trail to and from their northern hunting grounds. With tidal access to the Delaware River, the location was quickly recognized by European settlers as an ideal situation for water powered mills and river commerce.\n\nToday, Holmesburg takes pride in the natural beauty of its surroundings and in the diversity of its family oriented urban-village population and in its continued presence as a center of business and civic consciousness in greater Northeast Philadelphia.",

Our neighborhood is rich in buildings from the 18th and 19th century and in order to ensure this treasure for the future we are committed to preserving it.  Early in the history of our country, Philadelphia was the largest city, which brought along with it the difficulties of people living in close proximity to each other especially during the summer when disease was rampant.  Germantown was far enough from the city to escape the disease and close enough to be reached by horse and carriage in a day.  Some of the lucky city dwellers spent the summer in good health up here with clean air and water.  Even George Washington once stayed in PKNA for the summer in a house on Germantown Avenue and School House Lane.',

Members meet once a month between September and June, with further special meetings held as necessary.  The meetings begin at 7:00 PM on the second Tuesday of the month.  The Walker Lodge of the I.O.O.F. kindly allows the Civic to meet at its building, which is located at 1290 Southampton Road in Somerton.\n\nAt Civic meetings, members discuss events of importance to Somerton.  The Civic serves as a Registered Community Organization for Somerton pursuant to the City's Zoning Code, so its members are often asked to consider zoning variances, and they take an active interest in development and land use in the community.  Speakers are frequently invited to Civic meetings.  Members often bring problems in the neighborhood to the attention of elected officials or their staff members who regularly attend Civic meetings, or to the police, who conduct the monthly meeting of Police ServiceArea 3 of the 7th Police District during the Civic meeting. The Civic's board meets prior to member meetings.  The board and members also work outside the context of meetings to serve the purposes of the organization.\n\nThe Somerton Civic Association is more than 70 years old, and the neighborhood's residents organized to advocate for Somerton long before that.  In 1975, the Civic became a nonprofit corporation.",
