In 2016, 11th Hour was awarded a New Theatre Works Initiative grant by the Independence Foundation, and in 2013, 11th Hour became the first-ever recipients of the June and Steve Wolfson Award for an Evolving Theater. Our work focuses on presenting intimate, character-driven stories rather than flashy, budget-busting spectacles. Our hope is that these stories prove the relevance of musical theatre in the contemporary world, engaging audiences and inspiring the next generation of musical theatre artists for years to come.\n\nWe produce a broad spectrum of musicals that fill a niche in the diverse Philadelphia theatre landscape: musicals that spark the creativity of our artists and the imaginations of our audience. In the 2014-2015 season, we produced our first world premiere, Michael Ogborn�s Field Hockey Hot, which was a smashing success, and motivated us to create one of the first original cast albums to come out of Philadelphia in years. To date, we have produced twenty-one full-scale musicals, ten of which were Philadelphia premieres. Our hugely popular Next Step Concert Series is a staged-reading series that showcases musicals seldom seen in Philadelphia. In addition to Field Hockey Hot, the company has contributed to the development of several new musicals beginning with Angst, a ten-minute musical that premiered in the Spark Festival of 2005. We produced the American premiere of Austentatious that went on to success at the New York Musical Theatre Festival; and a 29-hour reading of Fantasy Football, the Musical? before its production at New York University. Both Austentatious and Fantasy Football have since been published and are now professionally licensed. In the fall of 2014, we partnered with University of the Arts to workshop Persephone Unplugged, a new twist on the classic Greek myth.",

        "__22": "A Little Taste of Everything (ALTOE) is a non-profit agency whose mission is to increase access to nutritious, affordable foods and provide food system education for low-income populations in Philadelphia. ALTOE grew out of a youth-driven project at University City High School (UCHS) in conjunction with the Urban Nutrition Initiative (UNI) and received its non-profit status in 2005. ALTOE evolved from previous efforts to improve food security in West Philadelphia communities through school gardens and farmers� markets.\n\nALTOE�s mission is put into action through the Mill Creek Farm (MCF), an educational urban farm project. The Mill Creek Farm (MCF) is located at 4901 Brown Street in the Mill Creek Neighborhood of West Philadelphia.  The Mill Creek runs under the land we work on and was enclosed in a sewer 100 years ago. Housing was built on fill that was not stable for the foundations and began to subside. It was eventually torn down in the 1970s. Since that time there has been a community garden on the western portion of the block, but the eastern portion sat vacant except for trash and weeds until 2005.  In August 2005, the Philadelphia Water Department awarded ALTOE 1.5 acres of vacant land, at 49th and Brown Streets in the Mill Creek Neighborhood of West Philadelphia, on which to start the project. Initial funding for MCF came from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection�s Growing Greener Grant for Stormwater Management and the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society (PHS). The Mill Creek Farm had a successful first season in 2006, and has continued to grow and progress as a model for local food system development and sustainability education in succeeding years.",

As part of its mission, the Academy supports continuing education and research in cognitive therapy, provides a valuable resource in cognitive therapy for professionals and the public at large, and actively works towards the identification and certification of clinicians skilled in cognitive therapy. Certification is awarded to those individuals who, based upon an objective evaluation, have demonstrated an advanced level of expertise in cognitive therapy. The Academy includes physicians, psychologists, social workers, and other mental health professionals from around the world. To date, there are over 1000 Members of the Academy.\n\nThe Academy of Cognitive & Behavioral Therapies is a multidisciplinary certifying organization specifically for cognitive-behavioral therapy that evaluates applicants' knowledge and ability before granting certification. The exacting standards of the Academy are designed to identify clinicians with the necessary training, experience, and knowledge to be effective cognitive therapists. Lack of rigor in certification represents a significant problem for both clinicians and consumers. Certification by the Academy of Cognitive Therapy indicates to the public, potential employers, and other clinicians that the individual is a skilled cognitive therapist.",

Philadelphia�s natural history museum offers surprises for all ages, from changing interactive science exhibits to a children�s discovery center, a fossil dig, and opportunities to interact with real science experts.\n\nThe Academy�s working scientists spend their days focusing on critical global issues in biodiversity, evolution, and environmental science. In the field, Academy scientists have traveled as far as Vietnam to sample wild bird populations for emerging diseases such as avian influenza, and closer to home they have been studying the effects of natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale. These research efforts and many others enable the Academy to provide accurate, real-time scientific information to the public on environmental and sustainability matters.\n\nThe Academy�s collections contain more than 18 million specimens and archival treasures and rate among the world�s most significant in terms of geographic, biological, and historical depth and breadth. Many specimens in the Academy�s collections predate the institution�s founding and reflect the work of famous naturalists and scientists, including Thomas Jefferson, John James Audubon, Meriwether Lewis, and William Clark. This �library of life� records the extraordinary diversity of life on Earth and preserves a long-term record of environmental change.\n\nIn 2011, Academy CEO George W. Gephart, Jr., and Drexel University President John A. Fry announced the completion of a historic affiliation between the Academy and Drexel. This unique affiliation unites two of Philadelphia's most respected research institutions and promotes discovery, learning, and civic engagement in the natural and environmental sciences.",

This work led ASAP to rallying around the four citywide initiatives it has today � ASAP Chess, ASAP Debate, ASAP Drama, and ASAP Scrabble.\n\nThe impact of this shift in focus was profound. By 2007, ASAP�s four citywide initiatives were serving more than 4,000 youth.

Barrick as a humorous and heartfelt addition to a hand drawn nondiscrimination policy sign he was asked to make at his first job as a preschool teacher 20 years earlier.  Over the years, the possible interpretations of the phrase, any kid is capable & any kid will participate, eventually permeated all aspects of his methods as an educator and director. In January of 2004, AKWD became a 501(C)3 nonprofit born of Barrick's overwhelming desire as a preschool educator to finally \"get this right.\" Today AKWD is an innovative educational model. George Barrick passed away in 2008 but his project is carried on as a labor of love by  original collaborators and some new friends as well.\n\nThe intention of AKWD is to assist young humans in appreciating their own ability in a respectful loving environment. By acknowledging the multiple intelligences and diverse strengths of each child our  faculty of teachers and specialists introduce students to the value of questioning and exploring their immediate and expanding environments.",

Whether its art classes for children or adults, amazing art exhibitions, or cutting edge plays on the mainstage, there is something for everyone at Allens Lane.\n\nAllens Lane Art Center (ALAC) was founded in 1953 by an interracial group of Mt. Airy residents who were concerned about the dangers of increasing community tension. Most were parents of children attending local schools who felt that increasing access to the arts would be a way to bring people together as well as develop individual talents. \"Living Together Through the Arts,\" a program of The Ford Foundation and the Henry Home & School Association, originally sponsored ALAC.  We formally incorporated as a nonprofit organization - 501 c(3) - on June 29, 1953.\n\nALAC's founders saw creative activities as an effective avenue for channeling the energy of youth in a constructive way. Developing artistic skills and appreciation for the arts would help round the education of local youth and build self-esteem in a non-competitive way. Most importantly, creative activities would bring people of diverse backgrounds together and help them overcome prejudices. Today, Allens Lane still promotes \"living together in the community through arts\" by offering programs and activities that enrich the lives of numerous children and adults.",

It is estimated that twenty percent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and/or depression. Also, an alarming average of 22 veterans commit suicide every day here in the United States, that�s 8,030 in just one year.\n\nAlpha Bravo Canine was founded by a mother and son team to help the local community of veterans. Jennifer Green, CPDT-KA is a certified dog trainer and her son Kevin Daly, USMC was deployed to Afghanistan twice with the 1st Battalion 8th Marine Regiment. Upon Kevin�s return home, they decided to combine their knowledge and experience of dog training and post deployment struggles to tackle these growing problems, and help to lower the suicide rates of US veterans by providing emotional and physical support with trained service dogs.\n\nAlpha Bravo Canine believes in helping these brave warriors, who fought for our country�s freedom, by giving back to them.\n\nProviding these veterans a trained service dog. A fully trained service dog from puppy to graduated dog can cost approximately $25,000-30,000 for up to the two year time frame. Everything we do is � free of charge � A service dog will make a huge difference in their lives!",

The extreme care that every administration has taken of the funds derived from that famous 1891 Bazaar has given us a sound investment program today. It enables us to maintain an exceptional scholarship program: Numerous alumnae each year receive generous tuition support at colleges and universities. We also give Commencement prizes and tuition grants. Since 1963 we have contributed thousands of dollars as well as books to the GHS library. We donate to school funds and publications. In 1984 we began to subsidize the cost of Advanced Placement examinations taken by qualified seniors. Our support today ranges from capital projects like the installation of a dance floor and statue restoration, to student activities like the robotics team and academic competitions, to subsidies for graduation festivities. In 2001, we finished production of a video history of Girls� High that highlighted events of our school�s sesquicentennial year in 1998.\n\nNow over 4,800 financial members strong, as the alumnae association celebrates its 125th anniversary, we take pride in our heritage, and eagerly anticipate the challenges that lie ahead. Join us, in supporting our enduring tradition of excellence!",

The EMPF focuses on the development, application and transfer of new electronics manufacturing technology by partnering with industry, academia and government centers and laboratories in the United States in order to maximize available research capabilities at the lowest possible cost. ACI also provides training, consulting, testing, analysis, and engineering services to the electronics industry.\n\nACI was established in 1992 by its founder and current CEO, Alan J. Criswell. His vision was to develop a vehicle to bridge the gap between leading edge applied research efforts in electronics manufacturing and the successful integration of the developed technologies on the factory floor. Relying on a thorough understanding of the dynamics of the electronics industry and knowledge of the ever-increasing void in successful technology insertion, ACI successfully privatized a regional, government operated laboratory known as the EMPF in 1995. ACI transformed this facility into a National Center of Excellence offering best-in-class technical resources in electronics manufacturing to the U.S. Navy, the Department of Defense, and industry.\n\nToday, ACI's National Center of Excellence Model serves as a conduit to leverage the nation's best technical resources from government, industry, and academia in a cooperative and cost-efficient effort to maximize the development and insertion of electronics manufacturing technologies across a broad base of industrial partners. This leveraged technical capability has and will continue to contribute greatly to ensuring the competitiveness of the U.S. industrial base in electronics manufacturing.",

The Forum recognized that local Chapters could engage artists and communities in metropolitan areas more directly, vitally and efficiently than a distant, national entity could. Using this approach, the ACF Philadelphia engages composers and local residents with a wide range of creative, educational, and performance activities tailored to needs and circumstances specific to the city, its neighborhoods, and the artists who live and work here.

The museum�s founder, Dr. Amandus Johnson inspired a group of committed, successful Swedish-Americans to build the Museum as a permanent monument to Swedish contributions in the United States.\n\nThe Museum is located on land that was once part of a seventeenth-century land grant from Queen Christina of Sweden to Swedish colonist, Sven Skute. The Museum�s architect, Swedish-American John Nyd�n, combined architectural features from three prominent edifices in his design. He modeled the main building after a seventeenth-century Swedish manor house, Eriksberg in S�dermanland. The copper cupola atop the building is inspired by the one on Stockhlom�s City Hall, and the arcades which flank the Museum are patterned after those at George Washington�s home, Mount Vernon.\n\nThe Museum�s 20,000 square foot interior is currently divided into twelve exhibition galleries, reference library, curatorial storage and archives, offices, museum store, large dining room/conference area and kitchen. The Museum is available to rent for wedding receptions, corporate meetings, and parties",

On this basis, the restoration of Belmont Mansion became the first major project of the Fairmount Park Historic Preservation Trust in 1994.\n\nThe AWHS is a non-profit historic preservation organization that raises funds from membership fees, admissions, rentals, grants and donations. Through the Society, Belmont Mansion has become an interpretive and educational center for American history and culture.

By adding another �n� and making it a woman�s name, her small start-up group had immediate personality and warmth.\n\nToday, ANNA is a widely recognized vocal ensemble in Philadelphia, with 80+ singers, committed to musical excellence and promoting social change. Led by Artistic Director Miriam Davidson, ANNA�s membership embraces diversity of age, ethnicity, and gender identity; our music repertoire reflects the rich spectrum of human lives and struggles, shedding light on issues facing immigrants and refugees, young people, women, the LGBTQ+ community, and others.\n\nANNA self-produces two major concerts each year and performs many community outreach programs throughout the season. We can often be heard singing at benefits, rallies, LGBTQ+ community events, prisons and shelters � anywhere that music can bring a sense of hope and empowerment. ANNA has performed at numerous venues in Philadelphia and New York City, such as the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, the Annenberg Center, World Caf� Live, the United Nations, and Carnegie Hall. We are honored to have been invited to participate in the International Festival of Choirs to be held in Santiago de Cuba this coming October/November 2019.

In 1996, AVP established the Counseling Center, which provides free therapeutic counseling to children, families and individuals who have witnessed or experienced violence in their lives.\n\nIn 2005, AVP established West/Southwest Victim Services, a program supporting and advocating for victims of violent crime in a community-based setting. In October 2007, AVP began collaborating with the Medical Examiner�s Office where AVP�s crisis intervention specialists work to meet the immediate practical and emotional needs of victims� loved ones in the days following a homicide, including providing support at the time of identification of their loved one�s remains and assistance in receiving compensation for funeral and other related costs.\n\nThe Youth Violence Outreach (YVO) initiative was established in the fall of 2016. By identifying young people who have experienced violence-related trauma and providing them with effective counseling and therapy to help them process the experience, YVO works to interrupt the cycle of violence. The school-based work is a combination of services that provide trauma-informed care directly to youth, emphasizing outreach to adolescent males of color who have the highest rates of victimization and violent behavior and who are often difficult to reach in non-school settings.\n\nAVP programs and staff have been recognized by many local, regional, and national awards. In 1989, the organization received an award for Excellence in Victim Services from the National Organization for Victim Assistance and an award from the Philadelphia County Medical Society for Outstanding Health Services followed in 1994. Most recently, in 2004, AVP was a recipient of the GlaxoSmithKline Community Partnerships IMPACT award, given to non-profit organizations for excellence in improving the healthcare of the underserved in their communities.",

In late 2013, the city passed legislation to create a Land Bank that will dispose of vacant city property, and oversee the disposition of abandoned private property. In the Land Bank Strategic Plan adopted in December 2014, the East Kensington neighborhood was designated a focus area for urban agriculture and open space. To this end, Arcadia Commons is in the process of acquiring sixteen blighted vacant parcels in East Kensington that are in danger of being developed exclusively for expensive housing.\n\nResearch shows that urban green spaces not only foster community, but also contribute to the health and wellness of local residents. Arcadia Commons� designated parcels would be used for community gardening, a farmers market, and a pavilion for neighborhood gatherings, and educational workshops to teach people in the community techniques for growing herbs, flowers, and produce as well as marketable skills (soap-making, spinning yarn). The products derived from local production would be put up for sale at the farmers market or used for personal consumption. Through these methods, Arcadia Commons will serve area residents by providing affordable resources that will revitalize local business and build a healthy local economy.",

ArtSmart believes that all youth should have the opportunity to realize their full potential and is committed to providing an environment in which young people can thrive, achieve and succeed.",
        "__22": "ArtSmart was born in 2015 by co-founders Michael Fabiano and John Viscardi after long analysis of the US education system, role models, technology and the economic state of affairs for artists living and working in the United States. \n\nAs artists, Michael and John had also experienced the challenges of making a living while pursuing their dreams in their early careers. For many young professional artists, working one, two or three side jobs is commonplace. More often than not, these jobs are in an industry unrelated to their area of expertise, exhausting and pull focus at a time when it needs to be developed most. \n\nArtSmart was born out of these central ideas: to create an organization that gives students in underserved communities an opportunity to pursue their dreams and grow as human beings, while supporting actively working artists to accomplish their own professional goals. \n\nArtSmart launched its pilot program at Newark�s East Side High School in September 2016. The first program of its kind, ArtSmart will have provided over 25,000 mentor sessions by mid year 2020 in 28 schools nationwide. Lessons are free of charge to the student, while mentors are compensated a competitive rate for their time and focus. The foundation serves communities in and around San Francisco, Newark, Jersey City, Philadelphia, New York City and Chicago.",

They were convinced that the only way to free the Puerto Rican community from poverty and to promote its full development was by focusing on the education of young people and developing their leadership potential, self-esteem, and pride in their cultural heritage. The ASPIRA Association is currently the largest nonprofit organization dedicated to Hispanic education in the United States, with nine (9) national affiliates.\n\nASPIRA, Inc. of Pennsylvania was formed in 1969 and primarily serves the North Philadelphia community, which has the third-largest Puerto Rican population outside of Puerto Rico. To address the low academic attainment of youth in Philadelphia, ASPIRA began its hallmark Leadership Development program in 1969, which is still active in several schools today.\n\nFast forward to today ASPIRA, Inc. of Pennsylvania operates a variety of community programs, after school programs, summer camps, and an early childhood educational development program called Pequenos Pasos de ASPIRA. The work of ASPIRA schools as a charter management organization began when ASPIRA founded Eugenio Maria de Hostos charter school in 1998. ASPIRA has since founded two other schools and been given the privilege of managing two more by the School District of Philadelphia totaling the operation of five charter schools.",

By 1873, when the alumni formally reorganized, the AACHS was actively supporting the school�s activities.\n\nIt is critical for the future of the school that we, as graduates, give back to the school by: endowed gifts to support programs (including Science Fair, Robotics, Dramatics, Publications, Music, Art and Athletics); by our presence with Career Day; by support of special events such as International Day, and by promotion of Central�s activities through the media. We also participate in the student recruitment process, and help students and recent graduates with networking and interning opportunities. We administer close to $2 million of endowed scholarship and prize funds for the benefit of both underclassmen/women and seniors; the annual distribution of proceeds averages about 8%.\n\nThe ultimate demonstration of our commitment was the rebuilding of the Barnwell Library into a 21st century research facility and conference center. This landmark public-private partnership with the CHS faculty, students and the School District has changed the learning culture in the school. Teachers from all disciplines use the research lab to effectively teach students how to properly perform internet research.\n\nAACHS also provided for the construction of a new faculty lounge, and gifted laptop computers to all faculty members, allowing for more cross-pollination of ideas between members of various departments.\n\nThe Association works with the senior and junior class officers. They, as well as the president of the Student Association and the Editor-in-Chief of the Centralizer, participate in AACHS Membership of Managers meetings. Our Alumni Journal and web site highlight school activities to encourage graduates to connect with the Central of today. AACHS also works with the Home and School Association and support its activities to assist parents to support their children�s life at Central.\n\nAlumni, on an individual basis, support the work of literary publications, and robotics by working with and advising students. They volunteer to chaperone events, such as Museum Day, and pay for students to attend alumni events such as our annual lunch, annual dinner meeting, and Thanksgiving Day Victory Breakfast.",

At that time, in most states, homosexuality could be used as cause for the loss of licensure to practice psychiatry.  After the now-infamous appearance by Dr. John Fryer In 1972, and the behind-the-scenes work of several members of what was then referred to as the GayPA, the APA removed homosexuality from their diagnostic manual (DSM). This allowed a more open association of lesbian and gay psychiatrists, who no longer had to fear for their jobs if they were found out to be gay.  Even today, the mission of providing support and a safe space for LGBTQ+ psychiatrists to meet continues to be important to many of our members. AGLP is the oldest association of LGBTQ+ professionals in the country.\n\nAGLP is an independent organization from APA, but works closely with APA through LGBTQ+ representation on the APA Assembly (the LGBT Caucus of the APA), APA position statements, LGBTQ+ Committees of the DSM, the creation and staffing of an AIDS Committee, Awards, such as the Dr. John Fryer, M.D., Award, and research and advocacy of particular interest to the LGBTQ+ Community through our quarterly Journal of Gay and Lesbian Mental Health. AGLP offers an online referral service to those seeking LGBTQ+-friendly counselling, support, and psychiatric treatment. \n\nIn 2015, The Association of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrists changed its name to AGLP: The Association of LGBTQ+ Psychiatrists, in order to serve a broader constituency of members and patients in the LGBTQ community.\n\nAGLP continues to work with APA and independently to support our members and advocate for our patients.",

When the Pennsylvania Supreme Court refused to accept years� worth of research done by the legislative task force (which included our co-founder Dana Cook and board member Reggie Shuford), it renewed ACCR�s determination to continue to provide for and work alongside the lawyers who fight for their client�s lives. \n\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court�s landmark decision in Miller v. Alabama in 2016 prohibiting mandatory life-without-parole sentences for crimes committed by children, ACCR became one of the first organizations to participate in facilitating this new opportunity for a second chance for the hundreds of Pennsylvania prisoners. 25 percent of the two thousand prisoners condemned to life without parole as children were from Pennsylvania.  \n\nLooking forward, we know that if the death penalty were abolished, ACCR�s work would not be done.

The Avenue is one of the most vibrant and successful performing arts, residential, educational, commercial, and tourist destinations in the United States.\n\nEconomic impact from arts and culture on the Avenue of the Arts has grown exponentially creating thousands of jobs and generating significant tax revenue for the city and state. A study completed in 2015 by the cultural data project shows that over $795 million of economic impact is generated by arts and culture activities on the Avenue. These activities have created over 10,900 jobs, $265 million in wages, $17.5 million in local tax dollars, and $22.9 in state tax dollars. The Avenue of the Arts continues to evolve with significant residential development replacing office space creating new sources for economic development and commercial growth. South Broad Street has been recognized by the American Planning Association as one of the �Great Places of America�. The Avenue�s renowned performance venues, luxury hotels and eateries, universities, and residences are just a few reasons why the Avenue was given this prestigious recognition.",

The Barefoot Artist aims to train and empower local residents, organize communities, and take action for a more compassionate, just, and sustainable future.\n\nThe Barefoot Artist is a volunteer-based organization with few encumbrances of staff and overhead. Lily Yeh raises funds for specific projects that pair volunteer expertise with local people to improve environments, and to advance health, education, and economic development. When funds are raised for a project, a call for volunteers is held and some paid staff are organized.\n\nDuring the project process, participants learn Barefoot Artists methodology on community building and economic development through art. We aim to inspire participants to initiate new projects, bring other volunteers, find new funding sources and discover other opportunities to serve communities. We intend for the programs initiated by volunteers to become multifaceted and interconnected in order to serve communities in need.",

With this desire, she incorporated the company in 2011, sought out board members and other professionals, and by July of 2012, Beacon Theatre Productions became an official 501(c)(3) organization.\n\nSince 2011, Beacon Theatre Productions has found a place in the Philadelphia community: producing theatre that spotlights critical moments of the past to show the way to a better more equitable  future. Shows are often free to the public or offered at affordable ticket prices. Since 2011, BTP has brought plays to a variety of venues including schools, community centers, historical sites, senior living communities, churches and other indoor and outdoor locations. We have produced plays about the enslavement of people of color, those who worked for the abolition of slavery, the mistreatment of employees prior to the establishment of labor unions, the struggle to obtain woman's suffrage, the unjust treatment of Black soldiers during the American Civil War, and a deeper compassion for those experiencing trauma and grief. We have brought to life the characters of:  O. Henry, Arthur Conan Doyle, Frederick Douglass, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, C.S. Lewis, Sigmund Freud, Harriet Forten Purvis, Charlotte Forten Grimk�, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucretia and James Mott. We have also hosted other theatre artists' portrayal  of  historical characters such as Mrs. Deborah Franklin, Harriet Tubman, Richard Allen, Dorothy Day, Sojourner Truth and more.",

When students identify music as a passion we bring students into our transition team where students can receive further supports and lessons as they prepare to join one of our additional programs. Students can then join our Student Driven Music Academy or Practical Producer Program where they will have ongoing supports as they grow in their musical journey. Lastly students can join a Teacher Training Track where they can continue to grow into becoming paid teachers for the next generation.\n\nThroughout all of our programming we focus on helping our students realize their talent and grow their self efficacy. Beyond the Bars currently offers over 8 different programs throughout the city using two main models: Our Student Driven Music Academy and our Practical Producers Program. These programs are performed throughout North, West and Northeast Philadelphia and works to serve students of various backgrounds.

The First Continental Congress met here in 1774 and it was the location of the Pennsylvania Provincial Conference in June 1776. Their proceedings officially declared the Province of Pennsylvania's independence from the British Empire and established the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, mobilized the Pennsylvania militia for the American Revolutionary War, set up the machinery for the Pennsylvania Provincial Convention which framed the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, and enabled the United States Declaration of Independence to proceed. It was briefly occupied in 1777 by the British Army during the war.\n\nThe site was designated a National Historic Landmark on April 15, 1970.",

Our Resource page has fact and stat sheets about gun violence in PA, domestic violence and guns and suicide and firearms.\n\nConsistent with national data, about 2/3 of  the gun deaths in Pennsylvania are suicides. To learn more about why suicide is a critical part of our gun violence problem, click here.\n\nClearly, we have a serious problem that demands systemic solutions, focused on regulation, policy, enforcement, economics, education and public health.

During her tenure she became acutely aware of a growing vacuum between struggling children in school and families struggling to survive in the community.  She witnessed families first hand facing serious issues, ones that required greater support than she was able to provide in the context in which she served them.  Maryann in her 50�s decided to go back to school to obtain a Master�s degree in Marriage and Family Therapy.  Shortly after obtaining her degree, with the purchase of a corner row home, CFAR opened its doors to its first client with one room and one therapist. This row home was where CFAR would spend the next twenty years.\n\nAs the need for family therapy grew we set out to find our new home.  In July 2016, CFAR closed its doors to the row homes on Magee Avenue and moved into a location double its size on Bustleton Avenue. CFAR although much smaller than most agencies, made a name for ourselves through our unique family systems perspective.  Focusing on the family as a whole has been the key to our success in seeing lasting change in Philadelphia families.\n\nToday, under current Executive Director Jordan Brogan, CFAR serves an average of 350 families a week and has trained over 100 Marriage and Family Therapists.",

She missed baking challah with her family, and was looking for a connection to the Jewish community at her school. To solve this, Eli began baking challah with friends, and quickly realized she and her friends could use challah-baking to mobilize and educate others. They began selling the challah and donating the profits to social justice causes. Word of Eli�s project spread, and soon Eli was guiding students, from all corners of the globe, as they started their own CfH chapters.\n\nA decade after Eli�s first challah sale, CfH continues to thrive. Currently, thousands of Jewish student participants on 80+ campuses across the US, Canada, UK, and Australia gather on a regular basis to continue the centuries-old tradition of baking challah together and practicing tikkun olam in an inclusive environment. For all the volunteers and many of the customers, CfH provides opportunities to be involved in a fun and dedicated community, address humanitarian problems, develop and practice new skills, gain business and leadership experience, and engage in traditions of challah and tzedakah.",

CHILD USA is a child abuse nonprofit that cuts through the shame and the secrecy to gather and analyze the data behind abuse and neglect. \n\nAs a nonprofit think tank dedicated to protecting kids and preventing abuse, CHILD USA conducts research, compiles evidence, promotes ideas, and proposes the most effective policies to prevent childhood abuse and neglect. CHILD USA draws on the combined expertise of the nation�s leading medical and legal academics to reach evidence-based solutions to persistent and widespread child abuse and neglect. All child victims deserve justice, and CHILD USA aims to find the path for them.",

Clients are given sound advice, counsel and direction. Often we provide pro-se coaching in matters clients can handle without representation. We offer clients who qualify with a pro-bono or reduced fee referral to one of our referral attorneys. We also offer spiritual care to clients, both at and after clinic, to those who are interested. We try to offer the love of Jesus to everyone, and seek to help them in any way we can. We have become a lighthouse and a bridge in at-risk neighborhoods, a lighthouse they can come to out of troubled waters, and a bridge to a community of hope, that will care for them. We desire to be part of healing and revival in the city, as we bring diverse people together, urban and suburban, from all churches and racial backgrounds, for a common cause.\n\nAt our clinics, we handle all types of legal matters including, but not limited to criminal record expungements, wills and powers of attorney.",

In 1972 Clara Baldwin Manor was the first subsidized senior citizen living quarters built.\n\nIt was started out of the love Clara Baldwin had for seniors who could no longer afford to maintain their homes.  Starting Clara Baldwin Manor was a godsend to many seniors.\n\nThe 1970's was a time for promise and hope for urban neighborhoods and communities.  While working with then President Nixon on Civil Rights issues, Mrs Baldwin was asked, what could he do for her?  Mrs. Baldwin said she wanted an apartment building for the senior in her community, so that they could continue to live in the community.",

We�re not saying it�s easy; it�s not. But when someone�s on the brink, we have tried-and-true, step-by-step plans to pull them back. \n\nBest of all, even though we help tens of thousands of people with their personal economics, we�re not in it for the money.

Our school-based model helps children and youth address and work through social-emotional issues so they can succeed both inside and outside of the classroom.\n\nThrough our programs, we provide critical social services to students and families within our family of schools.

However, filing for bankruptcy can be burdensome and expensive.  Without CBAP�s help many people who would benefit from a bankruptcy are faced with either trying to hire an attorney they can�t afford or trying to go through the complicated process on their own.  Instead, because of our services, these same people will have their financial situation assessed by our supervising attorney and their case referred to a pro bono attorney or law student.  Our volunteers then walk the client through the many steps involved including, but not limited to, gathering all the necessary documents, completing the required forms, as well as advising the client about the debt counseling that is needed or court dates that are scheduled.\n\nUltimately, CBAP�s goal is to have our clients leave after receiving our services in better, more sustainable financial situations than when they came to us.

It is frequently seen as the �go-to� organization when bias is directed against Muslim individuals or institutions. Its status as the most frequently quoted American Muslim organization in our nation�s media also suggests success in �providing an Islamic perspective on issues of importance to the American public.�",

This partnership continues to raise capital to restore the building's once abandoned sanctuary into a professional performing arts venue. In 2012, Curio worked with Calvary to build another performance space in the underused basement of the building. This allowed Curio to expand its production season, and gave our education department more room to hold classes throughout the year.\n\nSince 2004, our programming has consisted of productions and education. On average we produce four shows a year for the public. Beyond our productions, we also run a theatre school for the local West Philadelphia students, as well as a theatre camp that runs throughout July. In 2015, the Education Department introduced a new program called Curiositeens. This is a free program for local teenagers that runs throughout the school year, and offers the students a chance to go deeper into their theatrical training.\n\nWe are proud to serve the West Philadelphia Community, and we look forward to providing our community with affordable theatrical opportunities in the years to come!",

Although Darren is no longer with us, his spirit lives on through the Foundation, which is committed to providing financial assistance to those who suffer from malignant primary brain tumors. The Membership of Directors, together with Amanda Daulton, vow to continue supporting those who are affected by this devastating disease and raising awareness for brain cancer.\n\nSince its inception the Darren Daulton Foundation has granted over $250,000.00 to more than 100 people",

        "__22": "Dawn�s Place utilizes survivor input into the on-going development of our program and has hired two Dawn�s Place graduates as key day staff members who work with residents. One graduate is the Resident Coordinator and the other is her assistant. Even though research supporting the treatment of CSE survivors is a relatively new area, we have incorporated current recommendations for best practices. The in-house therapist provides trauma-informed counseling both individually and in group sessions.\n\nDawn�s Place provides a safe, non-judgmental environment to up to eight women affected by CSE. We offer a year-long residential program. Each resident works with a social worker to develop a plan for recovery, moving through the program in phases designed to methodically and simultaneously increase responsibility for themselves, their future, and the community which enables them to build a sense of freedom and empowerment. Our holistic program includes trauma-informed therapy, peer mentor support, art and music therapy, mindfulness instruction, access to health care, education, legal assistance, life and social skills coaching, career training, finding housing, and access to a fitness area. We connect residents dealing with addiction or mental health issues with off-site intensive outpatient programs. As women progress through the program, the skills they acquire become self-sustaining, allowing them to become drug-free, sober, employed and able to live independently.",

The intention of its founders was to offer a stepping stone for singers, providing training and education through exposure to all facets of operatic production, and performance opportunities in a variety of operas. During the first year, two operas and a concert were produced at various Center City locations while a permanent space was sought.\n\nIn 1981, the Company discovered the Hermitage Mansion, one of Philadelphia's historic Fairmount Park homes, and began to lease it from the City. A year later, an outdoor stage was built in the natural amphitheater behind the Mansion and became the Paul D. Osimo Outdoor Theatre. The Mansion served as the Company's administrative base, rehearsal space, costume and scenery storage site, and the location for its Winter Concert Series in the living room. The mansion is no longer used by DVOC. The company has performed in several venues in the Philadelphia area since leaving the mansion in 2008. Currently DVOC performs at the Venice Island Performing Arts and Recreation Center in Manayunk.",

The primary goals are that the students will gain some insight into new directions for their research, learn new ways of thinking, and, in some cases, be connected with people who could help bring a potential product to market. All of this takes the form of a competition with winners receiving recognition, scholarships, and monetary prizes, as well as a chance to compete in the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair.\n\nMany of our competitors go on to some of the top colleges and universities followed by careers in STEM. Many of our past competitors have credited the work that they did for DVSF and the feedback that they received from our judges with starting them on their path. It has been proven that the \"inquiry-based hands-on\" approach to learning STEM is effective. In fact, \"inquiry\" is now a top priority in the state educational standards for Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. \n\n_",

Although not achieving success in the early years, an attitude and character was forming which would be the foundation of one of the most innovative and successful Brigades on Broad Street.\n\nThe Downtowners won their first championship in 1964 with \"Coronation\". The Brigade repeated as champions in 1965 with \"Genghis Khan and the Mongols\". After a 9th place finish in 1966, the Brigade won two more back to back championships in 1967 and 1968 with \"Trooping the Colors\" and \"Tomahawk to Peacepipe\".

Throughout the years, thousands of teachers, parents, children and youth have benefited from ECP�s programs. ECP reaches out to families from a wide cross-section of socio-economic backgrounds throughout the Greater Philadelphia area to teach them basic principles and values of parenting. These principles and values are not only necessary to become a good parent, they are critical to shaping a responsible society.\n\nThe foundation for all ECP programs is a researched-based curriculum originally developed in 1979 and continually updated to reflect new findings, evaluation feedback, and to meet the needs of new client populations. This curriculum has been used by organizations and workshops across the country. Because of Ms. Scattergood�s visionary leadership over 30 years ago, ECP has grown to become a leader in the field of parenting education providing services for nearly 2,000 students annually.",

These leaders realized that closing schools might provide short-term relief but would not address the long-term viability of the Archdiocesan high schools. In a groundbreaking decision, the Archdiocese transferred the management of 17 high schools and 4 schools of special education to Faith in the Future, a new nonprofit that is independent of the Archdiocese. This commitment to Catholic education is the driving force of FIF. \n\nBut the most important metric for Faith in the Future is student success. As Catholic schools, we embrace our mission to educate servant leaders prepared to meet today�s global challenges. SAT scores have been rising across the network, and 93% of our students continue their education at a two-year (12%) or four-year (81%) college. Our students embrace a commitment to serving others through meaningful volunteer work. Extracurricular activities and athletics develop well-rounded young adults.",

Programming initiatives support the mission and vision of the organization, continuing a close association with the Olde Fort Mifflin Historical Society.\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the British Army bombarded and captured the fort as part of their conquest of Philadelphia in autumn 1777. The United States Army began to rebuild the fort in 1794 and continued to garrison and build on the site through the 19th century. It housed prisoners during the American Civil War.

We�re located in the cultural heart of Center City Philadelphia, right on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. At every age, students visit museums, attend cultural events, participate in community service, and use the finest educational resources Philadelphia has to offer. Through interaction with the real world, students become resourceful learners and active citizens of our school, city, and global community.\n\nOur Pre-K through 12 academic program is an engaging and connected educational journey. It�s carefully constructed to guide students through every stage of learning in a warm and welcoming environment where failure is not feared or believed to be fixed. At the core is a firm foundation of Quaker values. During weekly Meeting for Worship, our students and teachers sit in silent search for Truth and if moved to speak, rise to share. Seniors graduate from Friends Select with the knowledge and understanding of peaceful resolution to conflict, empathy, service to others, mutual respect, inclusion, and stewardship",

The current school building was built in 1891 at the direction of then pastor (later Archbishop) Edmond Prendergast.  The school�s faculty was initially comprised of Sisters of Mercy. In the early days of the school, boys and girls were educated separately.  Under the direction of Mother M. Edmonda Prendergast, calisthenics and elocution were introduced to the curriculum.  Mother Prendergast was also the first principal to have a graduation ceremony for eighth grade students.\n\nAt the turn of the century Saint Malachy School served 600 students.  Most students went off to work after eighth grade but some attend high schools such as Roman Catholic High School for Boys and Catholic Girls High (now Hallahan).  The 20th century brought many changes to the school.  Most of the Irish families moved from the neighborhood and a large number of African Americans migrated from the south.  More lay faculty members taught at the school and the Sisters of Mercy ended their time at Saint Malachy School in 1992.\n\nDespite changing demographics and challenges during the past 153 years, Saint Malachy School has remained an anchor in the community and continues its tradition of providing a quality education rooted in Catholic values to the children of North Philadelphia.",

Friends of UNIFAT is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization committed to supporting the educational and peace building initiatives of the Upper Nile Institute for Appropriate Technology or UNIFAT. UNIFAT is a private primary school located in Gulu, Uganda in East Africa.\n\nFounded in 1985 by Mrs. Abitimo Rebecca Odongkara, UNIFAT formed under humble beginnings with just a few students who received lessons under a tree. Mrs. Odongkara, who only a few years early had fled with her family to the United States due to the violent dictatorship of Idi Amin, decided to return to Uganda to help children left destitute due to war, displacement and the HIV/AIDS crisis.\n\nDespite these challenges, UNIFAT grew from that tree and became one of the best schools in the region, serving as a beacon of hope and a symbol of excellence in Northern Uganda. Today, UNIFAT School serves students from kindergarten through primary seven (the equivalent of eighth grade in the United States). UNIFAT�s uniqueness comes from its mission of �learning through love and understanding,� and its desire to not just educate children but to instill the values of love and peace.",

We aim to deepen the child�s sense of curiosity, independence, and wonder, strengthening a positive sense of self, helping each child to appreciate their own strengths and value.\n\nWe aim to fulfill the holy words of wisdom ��____ ____ __ __ ____ __ __ _____ __ ____ ____ Educate a youth according to his own way, so that even when he grows old, he will not stray from it� (Mishlei, 22:6)\n\nWe offer a multiage program for children ages 3-6 (through Kindergarten). There are also enriching before and after school programs.",

We engage directly with merchants and commercial property owners, and facilitate local access to supportive business programs. Examples include: assistance navigating city services, licenses, permits; helping businesses access capital; financial and technical assistance; grant and loan referrals; business planning; and more. Due to the current environment, assisting businesses with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, re-openings, and the application process for relief packages and other grant/financing resources has been an immediate priority. \n\nIn addition to direct services and door-to-door merchant outreach and site visits, we also monitor and encourage compliance with established regulations and report issues to relevant city agencies as needed.  We also look for opportunities to strengthen and diversify the mix of commercial uses in the business district, the potential to reuse vacant or underutilized properties, business and job attraction strategies, and seek available sources of funding to support recommended revitalization strategies.",

In 1982, a needs assessment of the 14th and 35th police districts in Northwest Philadelphia was conducted to identify community concerns. It became apparent that crime and violence resulting from escalating, unresolved disputes - particularly involving youth - were the social problems about which community residents were most concerned. In 1984, Good Shepherd Neighborhood House was established as Philadelphia's first neighborhood justice center, serving the 14th and 35th police districts. Good Shepherd Mediation Program currently offers mediation, and training and consulting services to the Greater Philadelphia area. In 2016, the Mediation Program moved to the Museum area to be more centrally located.\n\nGood Shepherd uses a voluntary mediation process designed to resolve interpersonal and community conflicts peacefully.",

Haile�s own inspiration to enter a career in law, a chance conversation with a female attorney that planted the seed �I could do that too�, led to history being made when Haile became the first African-American female Superior Court judge in Delaware in 1992. This shows the power of exposure, example and inspiration. \n\nWe strive to provide positive experiences in academics, cultural exploration and community service.  We see the benefits of our involvement in the lives of our students continually. Since participating in our programming, we have witnessed increased reading comprehension, improved grades on report cards, and a rise in overall confidence of the students. Additionally, the behavior of students we�ve worked with has been drastically improved vs. the general school population as a result of having a caring community�s guidance, encouragement, discipline and support.",

Using their own resources and their home as a base of operations, they created this family-centered community institution that effectively mediated gang conflicts and came to serve as a source of counsel and individual development for neighborhood gang and nongang youth. The family model �provides a sense of belonging, identity, and self-worth that was previously sought through gang membership� (National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, 1999:59). Through reparenting  and providing role models, the House of Umoja has �successfully transformed more than five hundred frightened, frustrated, and alienated young minority males into self-assured, competent, concerned, and productive citizens� (National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, 1999:16).",
